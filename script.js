  "Cambridge, Michaelmas Term, October.",
  "The wind bit, the sun hid, and on the first day of class, when she ought to have been lecturing undergraduates about the dangers of using the Cartesian severance spell to revise without pee breaks, Alice Law set out to rescue her advisor’s soul from the Eight Courts of Hell.",
  "",
  "It was a terrible gruesome accident that killed Professor Jacob Grimes, and from a certain point of view it was her fault, and so for reasons of both moral obligation and self-interest—for without Professor Grimes she had no committee chair, and without a committee chair she could not defend her dissertation, graduate, or apply successfully for a tenure-track job in analytic magick—Alice found it necessary to beg for his life back from King Yama the Merciful, Ruler of the Underworld.",
  "",
  "This was no small undertaking.",
  "Over the past month she had become a self-taught expert in Tartarology, which was not one of her subfields.",
  "These days it was not anyone’s subfield, as Tartarologists rarely survived to publish their work.",
  "Since Professor Grimes’s demise she had spent her every waking moment reading every monograph, paper, and shred of correspondence she could find on the journey to Hell and back.",
  "At least a dozen scholars had made the trip and lived to credibly tell the tale, but very few in the past century.",
  "All existing sources were unreliable to different degrees and devilishly tricky to translate besides.",
  "Dante’s account was so distracted with spiteful potshots that the reportage got lost within.",
  "T. S. Eliot had supplied some of the more recent and detailed landscape descriptions on record, but The Waste Land was so self-referential that its status as a sojourner’s account was under serious dispute.",
  "Orpheus’s notes, already in archaic Greek, were largely in shreds like the rest of him.",
  "And Aeneas—well, that was all Roman propaganda.",
  "Possibly there were more accounts in lesser-known languages—Alice could have spent decades poring through the archives—but her funding clock could not wait.",
  "Her progress review loomed at the end of the term, and without a living and breathing advisor, the best Alice could hope for was an extension of funding sufficient to last until she transferred elsewhere and found a new advisor.",
  "",
  "But she didn’t want to transfer elsewhere, she wanted a Cambridge degree.",
  "And she didn’t want any advisor, she wanted Professor Jacob Grimes, department chair, Nobel Prize laureate, and twice-elected president of the Royal Academy of Magick.",
  "She wanted the golden recommendation letter that opened every door.",
  "She wanted to be at the top of every pile.",
  "This meant Alice had to go to Hell, and she had to go today.",
  "",
  "She checked and double-checked her chalk inscriptions.",
  "She always left the closing of the circle to the end, when she was absolutely sure that uttering, and thereby activating, the pentagram wouldn’t kill her.",
  "One always had to be sure.",
  "Magick demanded precision.",
  "She glared at the neat white lines until they swam before her eyes.",
  "It was, she concluded, as good as it ever was going to be.",
  "Human minds were fallible, but hers less than most, and hers was now the only mind she could trust.",
  "",
  "She gripped her chalk.",
  "One smooth stroke and the pentagram was finished.",
  "",
  "She took a deep breath and stepped inside.",
  "",
  "There was of course a price.",
  "No one traveled to Hell unscathed.",
  "But she’d resolved at the outset to pay it, for it seemed so trivial in the grand scheme of things.",
  "She only hoped it wouldn’t hurt.",
  "",
  "“What are you doing?”",
  "",
  "She knew that voice.",
  "She knew, before she turned around, whom she would find at the door.",
  "",
  "Peter Murdoch: coat unbuttoned; shirt untucked; papers flapping from his satchel, threatening to tear away in the wind.",
  "Alice had always resented how Peter, who every day presented like he’d barely scooped himself out of bed, had still managed to become the darling of the department.",
  "Though this was no surprise: academia respected discipline, rewarded effort, but even more, it adored genius that didn’t have to try.",
  "Peter Murdoch and his bird’s-nest hair, scarecrow limbs balanced atop a rickety bicycle, looked like he’d never tried at anything in his life.",
  "He was simply born brilliant, all that knowledge poured by gods without spillage into his brain.",
  "",
  "Alice couldn’t stand him.",
  "",
  "“Leave me alone,” she said.",
  "",
  "Peter trudged into her circle, which was very rude.",
  "One should always ask before entering another magician’s pentagram.",
  "“I know what you’re planning.”",
  "",
  "“No, you don’t.”",
  "",
  "“Tsu’s Basic Transportative Pentagram, with Setiya’s Modifications,” he said, which impressed Alice, since he’d only glanced briefly at the ground, and from across the room besides.",
  "“Ramanujan’s Summation with implications for the Casimir Effect to establish a psychic link to the target.",
  "Eight bars for eight courts.”",
  "A grin split his face.",
  "“Alice Law, you naughty girl.",
  "You’re trying to go to Hell.”",
  "",
  "“Well, if you know that much,” Alice sniped, “you know there’s only room for one of us.”",
  "",
  "Peter knelt, pushed his glasses up his nose, and with his own stick of chalk quickly etched some alterations into the pentagram.",
  "This was also very rude—one should always ask before altering another scholar’s work.",
  "But standards of etiquette did not apply to Peter Murdoch.",
  "Peter moved through life with an obliviousness that, again, was excused only by his genius.",
  "Alice had witnessed Peter spill chocolate syrup all over the master of the college’s robes at high table with no more rebuke than a shoulder clap and a laugh.",
  "When Peter erred it was cute.",
  "She had herself once spent all of dinner in the bathroom hyperventilating through her fingers because she’d knocked a bread basket onto the floor.",
  "",
  "“One becomes two.”",
  "Peter waggled his fingers.",
  "“Abracadabra.",
  "Now there’s room.”",
  "",
  "Alice double-checked his inscriptions and realized to her dismay that his work was perfect.",
  "She would have preferred he’d made an error that left him limbless.",
  "And she would have truly preferred that he did not then declare, “I’m coming with you.”",
  "",
  "“No, you aren’t.”",
  "",
  "Of all the people in Cambridge’s Department of Analytic Magick, Peter Murdoch was the last person with whom she wanted to sojourn in the underworld.",
  "Perfect, brilliant, infuriating Peter, who won the department’s top prizes at every milestone—Best First-Year Paper, Best Second-Year Paper, Dean’s Medals in logic and mathematics (which were Alice’s worst subfields, to be fair, but until she came to Cambridge she was not used to losing).",
  "Peter was one of those academics descended from a family of academics, a magician born to a physicist and a biologist, which meant he’d been steeped in the ivory tower’s unspoken rules since before he could walk.",
  "Peter already had every good thing in the world.",
  "He did not need Professor Grimes’s letter to get a job.",
  "",
  "Worst of all was how Peter was so unfailingly nice.",
  "Always stumbling around with that blithe smile on his face, always offering to help his colleagues puzzle through hiccups in their research, always asking everyone else in seminar how their weekend had been when he knew very well they’d spent it sobbing over proofs that he could have done in his sleep.",
  "Peter never crowed or condescended, he was just guilelessly better than, and that made everyone feel so much worse.",
  "",
  "No, Alice wanted to solve this problem herself.",
  "She did not want Peter Murdoch yapping over her shoulder the entire time, nitpicking her pentagrams because he was just trying to be helpful.",
  "And, should she return with Professor Grimes’s soul safely in tow, she especially did not want Peter sharing the credit.",
  "",
  "“Hell’s lonely,” said Peter.",
  "“You’ll want company.”",
  "",
  "“Hell is other people, I’ve heard.”",
  "",
  "“Very funny.",
  "Come on.",
  "You’ll need help carrying supplies, at least.”",
  "",
    "Alice had stashed in her bag a brand-new Perpetual Flask (an enchanted water bottle that wouldn’t run out for weeks) and Lembas Bread (stale, cardboard-y nutrition strips popular among graduate students because they took seconds to eat and kept one sated for hours.",
  "There was nothing enchanted about Lembas Bread; it was just the extracted protein of tons of peanuts and an ungodly percentage of sugar).",
  "She had flashlights, iodine, matches, rope, bandages, and a hypothermia blanket.",
  "She had a new, sparkling pack of Barkles’ Chalk and every reliable map of Hell she could find in the university library carefully reproduced in a laminated binder.",
  "(Alas, they all claimed different topographies—she figured she would get somewhere high up and choose a map when she arrived.)",
  "She had a switchblade and two sharp hunting knives.",
  "And she had a volume of Proust, in case at night she ever got bored.",
  "(To be honest she had never gotten round to trying Proust, but Cambridge had made her the kind of person who wanted to have read Proust, and she figured Hell was a good place to start.)",
  "",
  "“I’m all set.”",
  "",
  "“You’ll still need help puzzling through the courts,” Peter said.",
  "“Hell’s very metaphysically tricky, you know.",
  "Anscombe claims the constant spatial reorientations alone—”",
  "",
  "Alice rolled her eyes.",
  "“Please don’t insinuate I’m not clever enough to go to Hell.”",
  "",
  "“Do you have a copy of Cleary’s?”",
  "",
  "“Of course.”",
  "Alice wouldn’t forget Cleary’s Templates.",
  "She didn’t forget anything.",
  "",
  "“Have you cross-checked all twelve authoritative versions of Orpheus’s journey?”",
  "",
  "“Of course I did Orpheus, it’s the obvious place to start—”",
  "",
  "“Do you know how to cross the Lethe?”",
  "",
  "“Please, Murdoch.”",
  "",
  "“Do you know how to tame Cerberus?”",
  "",
  "Alice hesitated.",
  "She knew this was a possible obstruction—she’d seen the threat of Cerberus mentioned in a letter from Dante to Bernardo Canaccio, only she hadn’t seen it referenced in any other materials she found, and the one book that might have contained a clue—Vandick’s Dante and the Literal Inferno—was already missing from the stacks.",
  "",
  "In fact, quite a few books she needed had kept disappearing from the library these past few months, often checked out on the very morning she’d gone in.",
  "Every translation of the Aeneid.",
  "All the medieval scholarship on Lazarus.",
  "It was like some poltergeist haunted the stacks, anticipating her project’s every turn.",
  "",
  "Realization dawned.",
  "“You’ve—”",
  "",
  "“Been researching the same thing,” said Peter.",
  "“We’re too far into these degrees, Alice.",
  "No one else could supervise our dissertations.",
  "No one else is clever enough.",
  "And there’s still so much he hasn’t taught us.",
  "We have to bring him back.",
  "And two minds are better than one here.”",
  "",
  "Alice had to laugh.",
  "All this time.",
  "Every empty slot on the shelves, every missing puzzle piece.",
  "It was Peter all along.",
  "",
  "“Tell me how to tame Cerberus, then.”",
  "",
  "“Nice try, Law.”",
  "Lightly, Peter punched her shoulder.",
  "“Come on.",
  "You know we’re always better together.”",
  "",
  "Now this, Alice thought, was really laying it on thick.",
  "",
  "He didn’t mean it.",
  "She knew he didn’t mean it because it was not true.",
  "It had not been true in well over a year, and that had been entirely Peter’s choice.",
  "She recalled it well.",
  "So how could he act so chummy, toss those words out so casually, as if they were still first-years giggling in the lab, as if time had never passed?",
  "",
  "But then, this was Peter’s modus operandi.",
  "He was like this with everyone.",
  "All warmth and cheer—but the moment you tried to step closer, solid ground gave way to empty space.",
  "",
  "Two bad options, then.",
  "Imperfect knowledge, or Peter.",
  "She supposed she could demand the relevant books—Peter was annoying, but he didn’t hoard resources—and figure it all out on her own.",
  "But her funding clock was ticking, and certain body parts were rotting in a basement.",
  "There simply wasn’t time.",
  "",
  "“Fine,” she said.",
  "“I hope you brought your own chalk.”",
  "",
  "“Two new packs of Shropley’s,” he said happily.",
  "",
  "Yes, she knew he preferred Shropley’s.",
  "Evidence of bad character.",
  "At least she wouldn’t have to share.",
  "",
  "She arranged her rucksack next to her feet, checking that none of the straps lay outside the pentagram.",
  "“Then all that’s left is the incantation.",
  "Are you ready?”",
  "",
  "“Hold on,” said Peter.",
  "“You do know the price?”",
  "",
  "Of course Alice knew.",
  "This was why scholars rarely ever went to Hell.",
  "It wasn’t that getting there was so very hard.",
  "You only had to dig up all the right proofs and master them.",
  "It was that a trip down below rarely justified the price.",
  "",
  "“Half my remaining lifespan,” she said.",
  "Entering Hell meant crashing through borders between worlds, and this demanded a kind of organic energy that mere chalk could not contain.",
  "“Thirty years or so, gone.",
  "I know.”",
  "",
  "But she had hardly struggled with the choice.",
  "Would she rather graduate, produce brilliant research, and go out in a blaze of glory?",
  "Or would she rather live out her natural lifespan, gray haired and drooling, fading into irrelevance, consumed by regret?",
  "Had not Achilles chosen to die in battle?",
  "She had met professors emeriti at department receptions, those poor aphasic props, and she did not think old age an attractive prospect.",
  "She knew this choice would horrify anyone outside the academy.",
  "But no one outside the academy could possibly understand.",
  "She would sacrifice her firstborn for a professorial post.",
  "She would sever a limb.",
  "She would give anything, so long as she still had her mind, so long as she could still think.",
  "",
  "“I want to be a magician,” she said.",
  "“It’s all I’ve ever wanted.”",
  "",
  "“I know,” said Peter.",
  "“Me too.",
  "And I—I need to do this.",
  "I must.”",
  "",
  "A taut silence.",
  "Alice considered asking, but she knew Peter would not tell her.",
  "Peter, when it came to the personal, was a stone wall.",
  "How easily he vanished behind a placid smile.",
  "",
  "“That’s settled, then.”",
  "Peter cleared his throat.",
  "“So maybe I’ll do the Latin, and you’ll do the Greek and Chinese.”",
  "He peered down at a segment near his right toe.",
  "“Say, why isn’t this in Sanskrit?”",
  "",
  "“I’m not comfortable with Sanskrit,” Alice said, peeved.",
  "This was just like Peter.",
  "Condescending, even when ostensibly just asking for clarification.",
  "“I’ve done all the Buddhist sutra references in Classical Chinese instead.”",
  "",
  "“Oh.”",
  "Peter hummed.",
  "“Well, that probably works.",
  "If you’re sure.”",
  "",
  "She rolled her eyes.",
  "“In three, on go.”",
  "",
  "“Right on.”",
  "",
  "She counted down.",
  "“Go.”",
  "",
  "And they began their chant.",
  "",
  "The dreadful, tragic death of Professor Jacob Grimes had been both foreseeable and avoidable.",
  "It was also, unknown to most, entirely Alice’s fault.",
  "",
  "That day’s exercise was nothing more risky nor radical than the thousands of routine experiments Professor Grimes had conducted in that laboratory space for decades.",
  "He was only retracing some basic principles of set theory cited in a new article he had coming out in Arcana, the top journal in their field.",
  "It was all utterly routine, and no more dangerous than riding a bike, so long as one double-checked their pentagrams.",
  "",
  "Professor Grimes did not double-check his pentagrams.",
  "He’d long reached the stage of his career where one left that sort of grunt work to graduate students.",
  "Professor Grimes’s days were devoted to profound, deep thinking.",
  "He saw above the mountains and clouds to discern the truth, and then he descended to utter pronouncements like Moses coming down Mount Sinai, and then his underlings hammered out the details.",
  "He never did his own arithmetic or translations anymore.",
  "And he was far above kneeling over tracing lines of chalk, straining his eyes, straining his back.",
  "",
  "One might find it reckless, foolish even, for a magician to leave his life in the hands of underpaid and overworked graduate students.",
  "But for one thing, Professor Grimes’s graduate students were the best in the world.",
  "For another, even graduate students at bottom-rate American institutions could identify the most dangerous mistakes in a pentagram.",
  "And this was Cambridge.",
  "After so many years of practice they stood out to any competent scholar like glaring red flags: gaps in the outer circles, misspelled words, false equivalencies, parentheses left unclosed.",
  "Anyone in a sound state of mind could have done it.",
  "",
  "But Alice was not in a sound state of mind that day.",
  "",
  "She was of course underpaid and overworked, but this condition was common among graduate students and no one cared much about it.",
  "But she had also not slept properly in three months.",
  "She’d drunk so much caffeine that the world shimmered, and her chalk trembled in her grip.",
  "She felt, as she often did, that her body had no defined boundaries from the material world; that if she stopped holding herself together as a subject, she would dissolve like a sugar cube in tea.",
  "She was in no state to work, and she had not been for a very long time.",
  "What Alice needed most then was a nice long holiday, and then perhaps institutionalization at some remote facility near the sea.",
  "",
  "But missing lab was not an option.",
  "Professor Grimes had not asked her to assist on a paper since last year, and though the work was beneath her, and though coauthorship was out of the question, Alice was desperate to get back in his good graces.",
  "",
  "Anyhow, tired to the point of collapse was a default state.",
  "The expectation was simply that, through some combination of strong coffee and Lembas Bread, one pushed through until all deadlines were met and one could collapse into an indefinite coma without consequence.",
  "Alice had spent most of graduate school in this state, and it was not so bad.",
  "",
  "But she was also angry that afternoon, and resentful, and confused, and such a turbid mess of frustration and fury that the very sound of Professor Grimes’s voice made her flinch.",
  "Perceiving his sheer physical proximity—sensing him move, kneeling in his shadow—made it hard to breathe.",
  "In the brief moments that their eyes met, her breath stopped, and she thought she might like to die.",
  "",
  "It was very difficult to concentrate in such an environment.",
  "",
  "So, when she drew the pentagrams, she did not close the requisite loops.",
  "With pentagrams, it was very important to close the requisite loops.",
  "Uttering incantations invoked the living-dead energy of chalk dust, and all that energy had an explosive effect unless contained properly within a defined space.",
  "Even the smallest hole could cause disaster.",
  "In fact, smaller holes were worse, as they concentrated all the energy to terrible effect.",
  "Therefore anyone who drew a pentagram performed what was known as the Ant Test: tracing a pencil tip from one point of the inscription all the way around to make sure any ant following the line would complete the journey.",
  "",
  "Alice did not perform the Ant Test.",
  "",
  "She did not, in effect, bother to ensure Professor Grimes’s body remained intact.",
  "",
  "It was the kind of mistake that could end careers.",
  "It would have, if anyone had seen Alice’s name on the lab logs or known in any official capacity that she was assisting at all.",
  "There would have been an investigation.",
  "She would have been questioned before a board, forced to recount in painstaking detail her every last error while they deliberated over whether it was grounds for manslaughter or merely reckless endangerment.",
  "She would have lost her stipend, been booted from the program, been interrogated by the Royal Academy, and been barred from studying or practicing magick at any institution in the world, even the sketchy, nonaccredited ones overseas.",
  "All this if she did not go to prison.",
  "",
  "But Professor Grimes did not generally credit his graduate students in his experiments.",
  "Assisting with his research, at the expense of their own, was simply an unspoken requirement of the program.",
  "No one knew, in any official capacity, that anyone was in that room on the day of the accident except for Professor Grimes.",
  "No one else saw when howling winds torn from infinite dimensions rushed into the pentagram.",
  "No one saw Professor Grimes’s eyeballs stretch out of his face before popping like grapes; his intestines spooling out and around his body like a jump rope, crisscross applesauce; his mouth twisting in a soundless scream.",
  "No one saw Professor Grimes’s body turn upside-down and spin for seven horrible cycles, exposed organs rippling, before flying apart in all directions, splattering every surface with blood and bone and guts.",
  "No one saw his brains on the chalkboard; the toothy jaw fragment landing plop into his afternoon cup of Darjeeling.",
  "",
  "And no one saw Alice strip naked in the lab shower, scrub herself clean, throw her clothes in the incinerator, and hurry out the back door, dressed in clothes from the overnight bag she always kept at the lab.",
  "No one saw her flee in the early hours across campus back to her room in the college, where she stripped down for a second shower and alternated vomiting and crying until she fell asleep.",
  "",
  "For all anyone knew, the first anyone heard of Professor Grimes’s death was the janitor’s screaming the next morning.",
  "",
  "By then the blood and bits had ruined the pentagram, and all the chalk was smudged with gore, so that no one could discern precisely what had gone wrong.",
  "A piece of Professor Grimes later identified as his liver had, happily, landed square on that segment of the outer circle Alice had fudged.",
  "They could only conclude it was a terrible accident, one only waiting to befall the most brazen thinker of his time, and stop the investigations there.",
  "",
  "Somehow, University Cleaning Services scooped together enough remains to fill a bucket, which were then transferred into a coffin.",
  "The college held a service.",
  "The department maintained a state of mourning for a week, during which all the students and faculty were forced to attend mandatory safety workshops run by colleagues bused in from Oxford, who with every sneering comment made it clear that they never would have been so foolish as to let a researcher explode himself all over a lab.",
  "Professor Grimes’s nameplate was removed from his office door.",
  "His graduate seminar was reassigned to a poor postdoc who understood less of the material than the students did.",
  "The city papers printed some stuff about what a great loss this was—to Cambridge, to the discipline, to the world.",
  "And then the summer ended and everyone moved on.",
  "Except Alice.",
  "",
  "She could have kept her mouth shut and gotten on with it.",
  "The university would have supported her to the end of her studies.",
  "Cambridge’s Department of Analytic Magick was very proud of its high graduation rate, and the faculty would have dragged Alice across the finish line, one way or another, even if this meant lending her out for several years to their rivals at Oxford.",
  "",
  "But Professor Grimes was the most influential analytic magician in England, and probably the world.",
  "Half the department chairs in the field were his close friends, and the other half were so frightened of him they would do anything he said.",
  "All of Professor Grimes’s previous advisees had gone on to tenured jobs at top-tier programs—the ones who graduated, anyhow.",
  "One recommendation letter from Professor Grimes as good as secured a post anywhere his students applied.",
  "",
  "Good jobs were vanishingly rare in academia.",
  "Alice very much wanted one.",
  "She wouldn’t know what to do with herself otherwise.",
  "She had trained her entire life to do this one thing, and if she could not do it, then she had no reason to live.",
  "",
  "So the next morning after Professor Grimes’s death, once his body was discovered and all the dust had settled, it seemed the most natural thing in the world to begin researching ways to go to Hell.",
  "",
  "Peter had a very nice spell-binding voice.",
  "Alice had always resented this about him, how his voice made hers seem reedy in comparison.",
  "She found it particularly disgruntling given how incongruous it was with his stick-thin frame.",
  "It seemed unfair such a rich sound could come from that stubbly goose throat.",
  "Every now and then a research paper surfaced on why male voices were better suited for magick, citing reasons of pitch, depth, or steadiness, and they always sparked a big hubbub involving outraged statements from women-in-magick societies and apologetic statements from journal editorial boards.",
  "Alas, no one had managed to conclusively prove these studies false.",
  "Unfortunately, Alice suspected the papers were right, and at this moment she was grateful.",
  "Peter’s confidence made her confident in turn, and she found herself lulled along by his smooth, reassuring rumble.",
  "",
  "“The target defined as Professor Jacob Grimes,” they intoned in unison.",
  "“The destination defined as Hell, or the afterlife, or the Eight Courts, or the domain of Lord Yama the Merciful.”",
  "",
  "They finished.",
  "Nothing happened.",
  "A second passed, then several.",
  "Then a freeze suffused the room, a creeping chill from nowhere that cut straight into their bones.",

  "Peter offered his palm.",

  "She slapped it away.",
  "“Shush.”",
  "",
  "“Sorry.”",
  "Peter’s hand hung in the air for a moment before he pulled it back, and Alice realized belatedly he might have been asking her to hold his.",

  "But it was too late.",
  "White light flared up from the lines of chalk, forming a silo around them.",
  "The lab room vanished.",
  "A great rumbling filled the air.",
  "Alice reached for Peter’s arm—only for balance, mind—but the ground lurched violently, and she toppled over onto her bum.",
  "For a moment she could see nothing, hear nothing over the roaring column.",
  "She felt a hooking sensation in her chest—not painful, only sharp, like some ghostly hand had reached in and yanked her heart out from between her ribs.",
  "The pressure was overwhelming.",
  "She could not breathe.",
  "She curled in on herself, hoping desperately she hadn’t fallen out of the pentagram.",
  "The rumble grew and the light brightened to a blinding white, burning through her eyelids.",
  "Visions of apocalypse exploded in her mind’s eye, oceans of blood beneath tongues of fire, planets collapsing into black holes, and for a brief, terrifying moment she was lost in the eruption, she forgot who she was—",

    "Angin menusuk, matahari bersembunyi. Pada hari pertama perkuliahan, ketika seharusnya ia mengajar mahasiswa tentang bahaya penggunaan mantra pemutus Cartesian untuk belajar tanpa jeda istirahat, Alice Law justru bersiap menyelamatkan jiwa pembimbingnya dari Delapan Pengadilan Neraka.",
    "",
    "Itu kecelakaan mengerikan dan tragis yang menewaskan Profesor Jacob Grimes, dan dari sudut pandang tertentu, itu adalah kesalahannya. Jadi, atas dasar kewajiban moral dan kepentingan pribadi—karena tanpa Profesor Grimes ia tak punya ketua komite, dan tanpa ketua komite ia tidak bisa mempertahankan disertasi, lulus, atau berhasil melamar pekerjaan tetap di bidang sihir analitik—Alice merasa perlu untuk memohon nyawa sang profesor kembali dari Raja Yama Yang Penuh Belas Kasih, Penguasa Dunia Bawah.",
    "",
    "Ini bukan tugas kecil.",
    "Selama sebulan terakhir, ia telah menjadi ahli otodidak dalam Tartarologi, yang bukan salah satu subbidangnya.",
    "Sekarang, tidak ada lagi yang menjadikan Tartarologi subbidang mereka, karena para Tartarolog jarang sekali berhasil bertahan hidup untuk mempublikasikan karya mereka.",
    "Sejak kematian Profesor Grimes, ia menghabiskan setiap momen sadarnya untuk membaca setiap monograf, makalah, dan selembar pun korespondensi yang bisa ia temukan tentang perjalanan ke Neraka dan kembali.",
    "Setidaknya selusin akademisi pernah melakukan perjalanan itu dan hidup untuk menceritakan kisah yang kredibel, tetapi sangat sedikit yang melakukannya di abad terakhir.",
    "Semua sumber yang ada tidak dapat diandalkan pada tingkat yang berbeda dan sangat sulit untuk diterjemahkan.",
    "Catatan Dante begitu dipenuhi sindiran dengki hingga laporan yang sebenarnya tenggelam di dalamnya.",
    "T. S. Eliot telah menyumbangkan beberapa deskripsi lanskap yang lebih baru dan terperinci dalam catatan, tetapi The Waste Land begitu merujuk pada diri sendiri sehingga statusnya sebagai laporan musafir dipertanyakan dengan serius.",
    "Catatan Orpheus, yang sudah dalam bahasa Yunani kuno, sebagian besar hancur berkeping-keping seperti sisa tubuhnya.",
    "Dan Aeneas—yah, itu semua propaganda Romawi.",
    "Mungkin ada lebih banyak catatan dalam bahasa-bahasa yang kurang dikenal—Alice bisa menghabiskan waktu puluhan tahun untuk menelaah arsip—tetapi waktu pendanaannya tidak bisa menunggu.",
    "Tinjauan kemajuannya sudah membayangi di akhir semester, dan tanpa pembimbing yang hidup dan bernapas, harapan terbaik Alice adalah perpanjangan dana yang cukup untuk bertahan sampai ia pindah ke tempat lain dan menemukan pembimbing baru.",

    "Sihir menuntut presisi.",
    "Ia menatap garis-garis putih yang rapi itu sampai semuanya berenang di depan matanya.",

    "Alice selalu membenci bagaimana Peter, yang setiap hari berpenampilan seolah-olah ia baru saja bangkit dari ranjang, tetap berhasil menjadi kesayangan departemen.",
    "Meskipun ini tidak mengejutkan: dunia akademis menghargai disiplin, mengganjar kerja keras, tetapi lebih dari itu, ia memuja kejeniusan yang tak perlu berusaha.",
    "Peter Murdoch dengan rambut sarang burung, tungkai-tungkai orang-orangan sawah yang seimbang di atas sepeda reyotnya, tampak seolah tak pernah mencoba melakukan apa pun seumur hidupnya.",

    "Ini juga sangat tidak sopan—seseorang harus selalu meminta izin sebelum mengubah pekerjaan akademisi lain.",
    "Namun, standar etiket tidak berlaku untuk Peter Murdoch.",
    "Peter menjalani hidup dengan kelupaan yang, sekali lagi, dimaafkan hanya karena kejeniusannya.",
    "Alice pernah menyaksikan Peter menumpahkan sirup cokelat ke seluruh jubah kepala kampus di meja makan, dan ia hanya mendapat tepukan di bahu dan tawa.",
    "Ketika Peter berbuat salah, itu terasa lucu.",

    "Peter adalah salah satu akademisi yang berasal dari keluarga akademisi, seorang pesulap yang lahir dari seorang fisikawan dan seorang ahli biologi, yang berarti ia telah terbiasa dengan aturan tak terucap dari menara gading bahkan sebelum ia bisa berjalan.",

    "Peter tidak pernah sombong atau merendahkan, ia hanya lebih baik dari yang lain secara lugu, dan itu membuat semua orang merasa jauh lebih buruk.",
    "",
    "Tidak, Alice ingin menyelesaikan masalah ini sendiri.",

  "Magick, disiplin ilmu yang paling misterius dan tak terduga, dipuja karena kekuatannya, dicela karena kesembronoannya, pada intinya adalah tindakan mengutarakan kebohongan tentang dunia.",
  "Apa yang ditemukan para penyihir peradaban kuno melalui ketidaksengajaan dan kecerdikan, dan apa yang kemudian dikodifikasikan oleh para filsuf-penyihir Inggris dari abad kedelapan belas dan seterusnya ke dalam kanon yang diterima di Euro-Amerika, adalah bahwa hukum alam dunia ini sudah ditetapkan, tetapi rapuh.",
  "Kau bisa menafsirkannya kembali dengan cerdik.",
  "Untuk sesaat, kau bahkan bisa membingungkan dan menangguhkannya, selama kau merajut jaring kebohongan yang tepat.",
  "Muslihat linguistik, teka-teki logika, semuanya berhasil.",
  "Yang perlu kau lakukan hanyalah menemukan serangkaian premis yang, meski hanya untuk sepersekian detik, membuat dunia tampak berbeda dari yang sebenarnya.",
  "Kapur, dan sisa-sisa energi magis hidup-mati yang terkandung dalam cangkang-cangkang hancur dari makhluk laut yang binasa jutaan tahun lalu, akan membereskan sisanya.",
  "",
  "Kini, Magick telah banyak berkembang sejak, katakanlah, ritual-ritual primitif yang disiratkan oleh prasasti kapur Uffington, dan sejak itu telah muncul banyak sekali sub-bidang mentereng yang sebenarnya tidak ada hubungannya dengan kapur, melainkan dengan segala macam benda misterius, musik sihir, dan ilusi visual.",
  "Seseorang kini bisa mempelajari arkeologi Magick, sejarah Magick, musik Magick, dan seterusnya.",
  "Di Amerika, ilusi visual dan pertunjukan yang mencolok sedang digandrungi.",
  "Di Eropa, mereka terus membahas hal-hal yang disebut Magick postmodernis dan pascastrukturalis, yang tampaknya melibatkan banyak mantra yang menghasilkan efek berlawanan dari yang diinginkan penciptanya, dan mantra yang tidak menghasilkan apa-apa sama sekali, yang diklaim semua orang sangat mendalam.",
  "Namun, semua Magick terbaik masih dilakukan di Cambridge, dan Cambridge yang bagus dan tradisionalis berdedikasi pada inti dari seni itu.",
  "Magick analitis.",
  "Kapur, permukaan, paradoks.",
  "",
  "Paradoks—elemen krusialnya.",
  "Kata paradoks berasal dari dua akar kata Yunani: *para*, yang berarti 'melawan,' dan *doxa*, yang berarti 'keyakinan.'",
  "Trik dari Magick adalah untuk menentang, meresahkan, atau, paling tidak, menggoyahkan keyakinan.",

  "Some didn’t believe in reincarnation at all.",
  "Some waited in the fields forever out of conviction that the great resurrection was coming, and that they need only sink into a stupor and wait for the end times.",

  "One of the more vexing problems with a sojourn to Hell was figuring out where to go and where to find the soul you hoped to rescue.",
  "Many souls had died since the dawn of time, and Hell was unfortunately a very large place.",
  "The solution was a Dowsing Anchor: a clause in the pentagram that used a physical token or object to root one spatiotemporally in the underworld.",

  "“So Macedonio’s Apocrypha states that most objects from the world of the living lose their directional force in Hell,” said Peter.",
  "“Sorry—I took it out before you had a chance, you couldn’t have known.",

  "Particularly something like a plaque, which is just wood whittled down.",

  "Most departments at Cambridge owned a cat, which was to say, the cats owned them.",
  "For the cats wore no collars, nor did they sleep in any professors’ homes, nor did they seem loyal to or even particularly friendly with any student or faculty member.",
  "All anyone knew was that one day a cat would show up mewling with hunger, and since no one could resist setting out food and water, the cat would stick around, growing increasingly pampered until eventually history was rewritten, and the cat had in fact always been a part of the institution.",
  "",
  "Analytic Magick’s department cat was a sleek, green-eyed, dark-gray thing with a magnificent feather-duster tail named Archimedes, and to the best of Alice’s knowledge he was unquestionably alive.",
  "She had seen him just that morning, batting idiotically at butterflies in the front garden.",
  "",
  "She knelt down.",
  "Archimedes did not like much to be pet, but he did prefer you make eye contact when speaking to him.",

  "“Apparently not,” said Alice, and braced herself to meet Professor Grimes’s first victims.",
  "",
  "Thirty years ago at Cambridge, a spell went awry and four undergraduates died.",
  "The postdoc on duty was stripped of his degrees and banished back home to Bristol in disgrace.",
  "All involved parties were students of the then-young Professor Jacob Grimes.",
  "",
  "Officially, the university blamed the deaths on a building fire—which was not technically false, because the resulting explosion had burned down the entire left wing—and sent the students’ ashes home to their parents, along with a letter assuring them that Cambridge was not in any way responsible, and that litigation would be a very bad idea.",
  "Conveniently an investigation revealed some faulty construction in the gas pipes, which allowed the university to place the blame on building codes and contractor malfeasance, not on what types of magical experiments could burn down half a building in the first place.",
  "All this meant the department was never blamed for what happened.",
  "It was a freak accident, nothing more.",
  "",
  "But no one ever asked why Professor Grimes let a fire rip through the lab to begin with.",
  "No one ever considered that, as a supervisor responsible for both the intellectual development and the safety of his students, Professor Grimes should have been paying attention to the progress of the experiment instead of being burrowed away in his third-floor office, a formidable “DO NOT ENTER” sign hung over his door.",
  "(He was so proud of that sign; a graduating cohort had presented it to him as a joke, and he had accepted it without irony.)",
  "No one ever suggested that perhaps, in addition to doing his research, Professor Grimes should have been fulfilling his duties as a teacher.",
  "He wasn’t the only neglectful professor, after all—all the faculty in the department cut corners when it came to teaching duties.",
  "Why waste time babysitting undergraduates when one could work on literally anything else?",
  "",
  "So none of this had any effect on Professor Grimes’s career.",
  "No one could prove it was his fault.",
  "You couldn’t draw a line between his actions and the fire.",
  "He hadn’t even been present.",
  "And anyhow, accidents were very common in magick.",
  "Just two weeks later an enchanted harp recovered from Assyria put half of Harvard’s department into a paralyzed slumber, and this greatly overshadowed the Cambridge fire on the conference gossip circuit.",
  "(No counter-spells were effective; the cure at last involved enormous amounts of amphetamine, which a surprising number of grad students had in ready supply.)",
  "It was generally agreed that magick required taking risks—especially the visionary, field-defining magick for which Professor Grimes was known.",
  "In any case, it was the undergraduates’ own fault, and they were dead already.",
  "That was punishment enough.",
  "",
  "As the Shades approached, Alice observed with horror that their appearances seemed locked onto their bodies in the moment of death.",
  "One of them seemed mostly intact—she had just a few scratches on her face and arms.",
  "One student died of smoke inhalation, said the report.",
  "The flames never touched her.",
  "She’d crawled into a corner and hidden under a fireproof tarp, and according to the firefighters this was why no one had found her until nearly an hour after the fire was put out.",
  "She might have been alive a long time—no one knew for sure, and no one pressed the issue.",
  "Her parents held an open-casket funeral in Ely and invited the entire department.",
  "This was before Alice’s time, but she was fairly sure Professor Grimes wouldn’t have gone.",
  "",
  "The others were burned beyond recognition.",
  "It turned Alice’s stomach to look at them.",
  "It was one thing to read theories of the dead; witnessing them was quite another.",
  "Charred limbs, petrified faces; jawbones stripped clean of flesh, teeth stretched, rictus-like, in unwilling smiles.",
  "Only the eyes were uniformly unscarred; staring, pleading, plaintive, curious eyes.",
  "Did they spend all eternity like that?",
  "Or had they only chosen to present themselves as such for now?",
  "The literature on Shades and corporeality was scant and undecided.",
  "Some scholars thought Shades were preserved unwillingly as they were in the moment of their death.",
  "Others argued Shades had the agency to manifest however they liked.",

  "Perspective was not reliable here.",
  "It was impossible to tell how quickly the queue was moving, or how much distance separated them from the wall.",
  "Professor Grimes might have passed through days ago.",
  "He might have been stuck in line, several yards away.",
  "Alice wished she had consulted some material about birth and death rates.",
  "How many people in the world had died over the past two months?",
  "How many had reincarnated since?",
  "She did not recall any archival information about queuing to depart Asphodel—Orpheus and all the rest seemed to just walk right into the courts—but then all the sojourner accounts were from a period when the world was smaller, when a more manageable number of souls came and went.",
  "Possibly this wall was a recent development.",
  "A sort of postwar chthonic immigration control.",

  "The lines looked dense, but weren’t Shades immaterial?",
  "Setiya and Penhaligon certainly thought so—Shades had only memories of their bodies, they were spirit stuff alone, and so they could not interact with the physical in any meaningful way.",

  "But even if they got through, Alice didn’t know what deities guarded the end of the queue, or whether they were disposed to help the living.",
  "And Professor Grimes was moving fast, with purpose.",

  "Peter was eyeing the wall.",

  "Accumulated detritus of millions of years of life.",
  "A mountain of preserved time.",
  "Though horizontally it was endless, vertically it was not—it appeared to stretch forty, fifty meters before it topped out to a smooth straight line.",

  "Peter asked, “How hard do you think that is to climb?”",
  "",
  "They marched perpendicular to the queue until the crowds thinned away.",

  "The Shades, for whatever reason, seemed uninterested in climbing up—possibly because they had no incentive to rush, and possibly because their tenuous materiality could offer them no purchase against that surface.",
  "",
  "A shame, thought Alice, because the wall really was ideal for climbing.",
  "Large bits of bone stuck out all over the place—lovely handholds, easily grasped—and the wall was littered too with grooves, perfect for digging one’s toes in.",
  "Alice was grateful that the wall was made of bone only—it seemed all the hair, fur, blood, and gristly bits had eroded long ago.",
  "There was no smell nor gore.",
  "Texture-wise, they were grand.",
  "Alice looked upon the wall and saw the Flatirons and Peak District; saw plentiful bottlenecks, chimneys, and cracks.",
  "The only problem, she surmised, would be endurance.",
  "But perhaps they could rest at the top.",
  "",
  "She took a deep breath, stretched out her shoulders, then dug into her bag.",

  "",
  "Up they went.",
  "To her delight, Alice found the climb deliciously easy.",
  "The grips were good, the wall full of friction.",
  "She yanked at every hold out of caution before she placed her weight against it, but every inch of bone held firm.",
  "Eons of accumulation had packed these materials so densely there was not a single loose bit.",
  "",
  "For a while she climbed and climbed, relishing the sureness of her grip; how effortlessly she could swing herself from hold to hold.",
  "The strain and repetition felt good.",
  "It was meditative; it took up all her concentration, so that the anxious radio in her head quieted down.",
  "It also felt good to realize she could still do this.",
  "She hadn’t taken care of herself these last few months; she had been afraid all her muscles had atrophied.",
  "On the other hand, she was so much thinner now.",
  "Less weight to pull—which did make a difference, though she wasn’t sure whether this lovely lightness came from actual agility or from starvation fuzzing up her head.",
  "",
  "After a while she stopped to glance about.",
  "She had loved doing this whenever she climbed in Colorado.",
  "She loved to appreciate the sheer distance to the ground.",
  "It never fazed her.",
  "At this height she was too far up to do anything about it but keep going, and this immovable fact helped to block out useless feelings like fear.",
  "",
  "Hell stretched endless beneath her, plains of silt and rolling dunes.",
  "To her tired eyes, this side of Hell abstracted to two rippling blocks of color: silky gray below and an orange burning darkly above, punctuated by a sun that seemed perpetually on the verge of setting.",

  "It was wildly inappropriate, but Alice laughed.",
  "“Murdoch, are you afraid of heights?”",
  "",
  "“I didn’t want to tell you,” he gasped.",
  "“Thought I could just—suck it up—”",
  "",
  "“It was your idea to climb!”",

  "“You’re fine, you’re fine,” she said quickly.",

  "“I think . . . that makes sense.”",
  "",
  "“And if you ever need to rest, get your feet on a good hold, stand up straight, and lean against the wall like you are now.",

  "He nodded vigorously, eyes wide.",

  "“Hesitation is your worst enemy.",

  "Peter obeyed.",
  "Up again they went.",
  "From this angle Alice could not tell how far they’d come, whether they’d reached the halfway point or not.",
  "All distance and texture were reduced to abstractions, lines on canvas, and all she could see on either side was an endless stretch of jagged white, then sky, or ground.",
  "There was no pacing herself to the finish.",
  "All she could do was ignore the passage of time, and the rapidly approaching limits of her own endurance, and keep throwing one arm up over the next.",
  "A watched distance never shrank.",
  "Hands, hands, toes, toes.",
  "Hands, hands, toes, toes.",

  "Finally her right hand met a flat, wide surface.",
  "She dared to tilt her head up.",

  "He got one hand up to the top.",

  "They lay still for a long moment, breathing hard.",
  "Alice felt something wet against her skin.",
  "She tilted her head down and saw Peter’s face crumpled against her neck.",
  "He was crying.",
  "",
  "“You’re all right,” she murmured.",
  "“It’s okay.”",
  "",
  "She would have wriggled away, but Peter was still shaking—a bit, Alice thought inappropriately, like a man after sex—and she thought it better to let him have this moment.",
  "She laid her head back and closed her eyes, relishing the sweet fatigue that pulsed through her limbs.",
  "",
  "Good God.",
  "She hadn’t felt this sort of pain in a long time.",
  "She’d been exhausted, yes, but this throbbing soreness—this screaming reminder that she’d pushed her body to the limit, and hadn’t broken; indeed, that she had a body that could do what it did—felt good.",
  "",
  "She tried to focus on that pleasant burn.",
  "Not Peter’s warmth against her chest.",
  "Not the absurdity of Peter lying on top of her, which was somehow, compared to rock climbing in Hell, the most ridiculous thing about this situation.",
  "Not the very weird stir in her gut she felt at his being vulnerable, depending on her, and how very unsatisfying this was despite the fact that she’d wished for so long that Peter might reveal to her any weakness at all.",
  "But all this did was make him seem human, and the more human Peter seemed, the more he baffled her.",

  "The thump.",
  "Back in Colorado, people were always flinging themselves off the rock wall in various embarrassing positions, just to make their friends laugh.",

  "Sometimes she did it on purpose.",
  "She let go when she was nearly at the top of a problem, or let her fingers slide off holds that were designed for beginners.",

  "She realized this knowledge was not very helpful at the moment, so she kept it to herself.",

  "",
  "She couldn’t make sense of it.",
  "Not wonder, no.",
  "Certainly not desire.",

  "She didn’t like it.",
  "It was too familiar.",
  "It recalled a version of her, of them, that no longer was.",
  "It made her feel things—and this was unacceptable, because over the last year Alice and Peter had determined the best way to behave around one another was to pretend they were both invulnerable as stone.",

  "The moment stretched—so long, indeed, Alice had opened her mouth, casting about for anything with which to break the silence.",

  "A friend studying neuroscience had told her once that eyesight was largely memory, that your brain saw a pattern and filled in the rest.",
  "Alas, Alice’s memory bank was bursting at the seams.",
  "The mix-and-match mechanism was broken, and her brain filled in patterns with the most inappropriate things.",
  "Chalkboards became parking lots.",

  "Once she blinked, and she saw what seemed like Cambridge from a bird’s-eye view; bell towers, college courts, old stone department buildings along cobbled roads.",
  "But try as she might she could not sustain her gaze for long.",
  "This was not her fault; the landscape was playing with her.",
  "It was like standing before an autostereogram illusion.",
  "If her eyes shifted focus ever so slightly, then the image transformed.",
  "She saw straight paths morph into winding labyrinths.",
  "She saw a sprawling terrain morph into a radial pattern.",
  "She saw reefs of coral.",
  "She saw a shimmering black line that at times seemed to bind the entire plane; but at others, it vanished into a pinprick at the center of a circle, a black hole that pulled everything within it.",

  "Akhir-akhir ini, maksudku.”",
  "“Dia penyihir terhebat yang masih hidup.",
  "Kau akan bodoh jika tidak tegang.”",
  "Peter mempertimbangkan ini, lalu mengangguk.",
  "“Aku tidak bermaksud menyiratkan bahwa hubungan kalian—hubungan kalian buruk.",
  "Aku hanya berpikir kalian tidak terlalu menyukai satu sama lain.",

  "Ya, hubungan antara dirinya dan Profesor Grimes memang terasa dingin dalam minggu-minggu menjelang kematiannya.",
  "Ya, beliau pernah membentaknya sekali atau dua kali dan ia balas membentak dan seluruh departemen mungkin menyadarinya.",
  "Mungkin membicarakannya saat ia tidak ada.",
  "Membayangkan bisik-bisik mereka membuat perutnya mual karena malu—begitu pula wajah Peter yang ingin tahu dan pura-pura peduli.",
  "",
  "“Mengesampingkan masalah pribadi apa pun,” katanya datar, “Profesor Grimes adalah kesempatan terbaikku untuk mendapatkan pekerjaan.”",

  "Sesuatu, jelas, ada di ujung lidahnya—tetapi ia tidak akan mengatakannya, setidaknya tidak kepadanya.",
  "",
  "Alice hampir bertanya apa maksud Peter sebelumnya, ketika ia mengatakan Profesor Grimes adalah kesempatan terakhirnya di profesi ini.",
  "Ia berharap tahu apa yang telah terjadi.",
  "Setiap departemen di bidang ini begitu menginginkan Peter Murdoch.",
  "Sudah menjadi rahasia umum bahwa departemen-departemen kelas dua telah mengincar dan mencoba memberikan tawaran kerja lebih awal sejak ia lulus ujian kualifikasi.",
  "Tetapi ia tidak bisa memikirkan cara untuk menanyakan ini tanpa terdengar terlalu ingin tahu, atau terang-terangan tidak sopan.",
  "Mungkin dulu ia bisa.",
  "Tetapi keakraban itu sudah lama sirna.",
  "Dan jika ia mendesak, ia tahu, Peter hanya akan menghindar.",

  "“Yah,” katanya akhirnya, “kurasa aku akan mencari pembimbing baru setelah Cooke.”",
  "Jantung Alice berdebar kencang.",
  "“Kau memenangkan Cooke?”",
  "“Aku baru tahu minggu lalu,” katanya.",
  "“Siklus penerimaan mereka tertunda tahun ini karena—yah, kau tahu.",
  "Kecelakaan itu.”",
  "Alice merasa agak sulit bernapas saat itu.",
  "Pipinya terasa panas, dan kepalanya terasa anehnya ringan.",
  "Ia berharap, saat masih sarjana, reaksi fisiologis yang intens terhadap rasa cemburu ini pada akhirnya akan hilang, tetapi seiring ia menjalani sekolah pascasarjana, reaksi itu malah semakin parah.",
  "Setiap makalah yang diterbitkan, setiap undangan konferensi, memicu respons panik lawan-atau-lari, respons yang tidak pernah bisa ia sembunyikan dengan baik.",
  "",
  "Jadi bukan dia; jadi harapannya salah.",
  "“Selamat,” katanya, dengan sangat ringan, agar suaranya tidak pecah.",
  "“Itu luar biasa.”",
  "“Terima kasih,” kata Peter.",
  "“Aku benar-benar tidak yakin akan mendapatkannya, tapi kurasa mereka menyukai proposal-ku.”",
  "“Tentu saja mereka menyukainya,” katanya datar.",
  "“Maaf, aku tidak bermaksud sombong.”",
  "“Tentu saja tidak.”",
  "“Aku hanya—semuanya terjadi sangat cepat, jadi aku masih mencoba mencerna semua ini.”",
  "Peter berdeham.",
  "“Maaf, itu tadi tidak bijaksana.",
  "Kurasa—kurasa, jika kau tidak mendapatkannya—maksudku, kurasa mereka hanya tidak menginginkan seorang ahli bahasa tahun ini.",
  "Eh—maksudku, bukan untuk merendahkan ahli bahasa.",
  "Tapi kau tahu maksudku.”",
  "Oh, persetan denganmu, pikir Alice.",
  "",
  "Tahun sebelumnya ia telah melamar, dan berharap memenangkan, Cooke Fellowship yang bergengsi untuk penelitian disertasi.",
  "Cooke Fellowship, yang didirikan seabad lalu oleh janda salah satu teoretikus pendiri sihir Inggris, sangatlah prestisius.",
  "Beasiswa ini tidak hanya menawarkan dana yang cukup untuk perjalanan musim panas ke mana saja di dunia, tetapi juga serangkaian acara makan malam dan pesta koktail sebelum dan sesudahnya dengan keturunan keluarga Cooke.",
  "Para keturunannya selalu saja menyebalkan, tetapi pesta-pesta itu selalu ramai dikunjungi karena tidak ada yang suka menolak makanan gratis, dan dengan begitu kau bisa berbaur dengan para elite akademis selama berminggu-minggu.",
  "Penerima Cooke Fellowship hanya bisa dinominasikan oleh anggota senior Royal Academy of Magick, yang di antaranya termasuk Profesor Grimes.",
  "",
  "“Kau akan mendapatkan Cooke,” ia meyakinkannya, berbulan-bulan yang lalu.",
  "“Oh, mereka akan menyukaimu.",
  "Kau akan menjadi kandidat terbaik yang pernah mereka lihat selama bertahun-tahun.",
  "Mereka sudah lama ingin menominasikan seorang wanita—kau sudah pasti diterima.”",
  "Dan karena saat itu Alice masih memercayai setiap kata yang keluar dari mulutnya, ia menghabiskan hari-hari setelah percakapan itu dengan mabuk kepayang karena gembira.",
  "",
  "Tetapi kemudian beberapa bulan berlalu, dan Profesor Grimes mulai mengalihkan pembicaraan setiap kali Alice menyinggungnya.",
  "Ia mencoba melakukannya dengan halus.",
  "Ia akan menyebutkan kesempatan penelitian lain dan melanjutkannya dengan, “Meskipun kurasa itu akan bentrok dengan Cooke.”",
  "Tetapi yang ia dapatkan hanyalah anggukan dan gumaman yang mengelak.",
  "“Kita lihat saja nanti,” katanya.",
  "“Itu selalu untung-untungan.”",
  "Dan kemudian, “Kau tahu, Cooke itu sangat kompetitif.”",
  "Dan setelah itu, “Kudengar mereka tidak terlalu suka dengan ahli bahasa.”",
  "",
  "Sekitar waktu daftar pendek Cooke seharusnya diumumkan, ia mulai memeriksa loker suratnya tiga kali sehari.",
  "Lucu bagaimana ketika sesuatu yang sangat besar dipertaruhkan, kau menolak untuk memercayai bukti di depan matamu sendiri.",
  "Setiap hari ia menatap lubang kosong itu dan mencoba meyakinkan dirinya sendiri bahwa semua persepsinya salah; bahwa jika saja ia menatap cukup keras, sebuah amplop ungu tebal akan muncul di tengah-tengah debu.",
  "Ia melonjak setiap kali telepon berdering.",
  "Ia menguping rapat-rapat fakultas.",
  "Ia terpicu hanya dengan penyebutan kata “Cooke,” yang membuat percakapan tentang makanan menjadi sangat sulit.",
  "",
  "Ia merasa sangat bodoh sekarang.",
  "Tentu saja beasiswa itu tidak jatuh padanya.",
  "",
  "Ia menginginkan sesuatu untuk menyakitinya saat itu.",
  "Peter tahu apa yang telah dilakukannya, melemparkan fakta itu ke wajahnya.",
  "Ia seharusnya tahu bagaimana rasanya.",
  "",
  "“Aku juga berpikir tentang pembimbing baru.”",
  "Ia mencoba terdengar sangat santai.",
  "“Maksudku, Grimes memang memperkenalkanku pada beberapa kolega saat kami di Italia.",
  "Aku berpikir untuk menghubungi mereka setelah kecelakaan itu, tapi Eropa sebenarnya bukan pilihan pertamaku untuk gelar.",
  "Mereka semua sangat—pasca-modernis di sana, menurutmu tidak?”",
  "",
  "Berhasil.",

  "Semua orang tahu Peter seharusnya menemani Profesor Grimes ke Roma untuk konferensi dwitahunan Arcana.",
  "Tetapi Peter, gerutu Profesor Grimes, sedang tidak enak badan akhir-akhir ini.",

  "“Ada sesuatu yang terjadi dengan anak itu.",
  "Dia batal ikut.",
  "Kesempatan itu milikmu, Alice, jika kau mau.”",
  "",
  "“Aku akan berkemas malam ini,” desah Alice.",
  "Ia merasa sangat beruntung saat itu sehingga ia bahkan tidak repot-repot bertanya-tanya mengapa Grimes tidak memilihnya untuk perjalanan itu sejak awal, atau apa yang terjadi dengan Peter, atau bahkan apakah mungkin seseorang harus memeriksa keadaan Peter.",
  "Profesor Grimes memang punya efek seperti itu.",
  "Jika ia berhasil membuatmu sendirian, jika ia mengucapkan sepatah kata pujian, segalanya seolah sirna.",
  "",
  "Itu, memang, musim panas yang luar biasa di Italia.",
  "Alice dan Profesor Grimes tidak hanya membuat satu, tetapi tiga terobosan penting di bidang mereka.",
  "Ia pulang dengan kulit kecokelatan, makan enak, dan berseri-seri karena perhatian dan pujian.",
  "Itu adalah puncak kariernya di Cambridge, dan ia ingin Peter tahu persis apa yang telah dilewatkannya.",
  "",
  "Ia tidak tahu apakah itu berhasil.",

  "Keheningan menggantung di antara mereka.",

  "“Dengar, aku minta maaf telah menyinggung soal Cooke.”",
  "“Dan aku minta maaf telah menyinggung soal Italia.”",
  "Alice merasa sangat lelah saat itu.",
  "Sendirian, bersama Peter Murdoch, di Neraka—ia tidak tahu berapa lama lagi ia bisa menahan ini.",
  "Ia membuka ritsleting ranselnya dan merogoh-rogoh dasarnya sampai menemukan selimut kemahnya.",
  "“Bagaimana kalau kita diam saja dan tidur.”",
  "",
  "“Apa itu?” tanya Peter.",
  "“Selimut hipotermia.”",
  "Alice membuka lipatan lembaran aluminium itu dan menyelimuti kakinya.",
  "“Ini mengisolasi panas tubuh.",
  "Aku meminjamnya dari salah satu penghuni asrama.”",
  "",
  "Satu keuntungan yang dimiliki Alice di Neraka adalah ia tahu cara berkemas untuk perjalanan jauh; tahu persis sepatu dan ransel mana yang ia butuhkan untuk bertahan berhari-hari berjalan kaki.",
  "Peralatan masak—tidak, ia punya Roti Lembas.",
  "Pakaian hangat—ya.",
  "Kapur tulis dan pisau—tentu saja, ya.",
  "Ia cukup suka kegiatan luar ruangan sebelum datang ke Inggris.",
  "Di Cornell, ia menghabiskan sebagian besar akhir pekannya menyusuri jalur pendakian ngarai.",
  "Ia dibesarkan di Rockies.",
  "Ia pernah mendaki Yosemite dan Appalachian Trail tanpa bantuan.",
  "Inilah yang meyakinkannya bahwa ia bisa melakukan perjalanan ini.",
  "Ia pernah menaklukkan White Mountains.",
  "Seberapa jauh lebih buruknya Neraka?",
  "",
  "Meskipun sebenarnya, semua itu terasa seperti meraih kehidupan sebelumnya.",
  "Alice sudah lama sekali tidak mendaki.",
  "Juga tidak memanjat, sejujurnya.",
  "Ia punya begitu banyak hobi sebelum mulai di Cambridge.",
  "Dulu ia tahu bagaimana rasanya udara segar.",
  "Selama ini di laboratorium Grimes telah mengubahnya menjadi hantu yang hidup dari sup kalengan dan biskuit.",
  "Dan ia terkejut, setelah menggali sampai ke dasar lemarinya, bahwa ia masih memiliki tas mendaki itu.",
  "",
  "“Keren sekali.”",
  "Peter bersandar, meletakkan kepalanya di atas ranselnya.",

  "“Apa kau tidak berpikir akan tidur?”",
  "“Yah, aku sudah sering tidur di lab sebelumnya, ingat?",
  "Kita tidak butuh selimut waktu itu.”",
  "“Murdoch, di sini dingin sekali.”",
  "Alice duduk tegak.",
  "Sebagian dari dirinya sudah menyesali ini, tetapi ia merasa harus menawarkannya.",
  "Kalau tidak, Peter akan terlihat terlalu menyedihkan.",
  "“Kau mau berbagi?”",
  "",
  "“Ah—yah, kelihatannya agak kecil.”",
  "“Ini bisa dilebarkan lagi.”",
  "Ia mengangkat salah satu ujungnya.",
  "“Lihat?”",
  "Peter mengerjap, mempertimbangkan.",
  "“Aku akan menyelipkan kakiku saja di bawahnya.”",
  "“Kau yakin?”",
  "“Itu sudah cukup untuk menghangatkanku.”",
  "“Terserah kau saja.”",
  "",
  "Peter bergeser mendekatinya.",
  "Ada gerakan canggung yang tak terhindarkan saat mengatur posisi tangan dan kaki, saat beringsut untuk menentukan batas-batas fisik dan emosional, tetapi akhirnya mereka menemukan posisi yang setidaknya menutupi bagian bawah tubuh Peter tanpa membuat tubuh mereka bersentuhan terlalu dekat.",
  "",
  "“Baiklah, selamat malam,” kata Peter.",
  "“Selamat malam,” gumam Alice.",
  "",
  "Alice selalu kesulitan tidur saat berkemah.",
  "Ia tidak suka berada di tempat terbuka pada malam hari, tanpa setidaknya lima dinding kokoh yang memisahkannya dari hal-hal yang ingin memangsanya.",
  "Dan seharusnya ia lebih cemas lagi di sini; di bawah langit Neraka yang tanpa bulan dan tanpa bintang; dengan entah-apa-yang-mengintai di bukit-bukit pasir.",
  "Tetapi kelelahan mengalahkan segalanya—dan sejujurnya, begitu pula irama napas Peter yang rata dan teratur, akrab layaknya lagu pengantar tidur.",
  "Tak lama kemudian ia sudah tertidur lelap, dan secara ajaib, untuk pertama kalinya dalam berbulan-bulan, ia tidak bermimpi.",
  "",
  "Semua orang menyarankan para calon penyihir untuk setidaknya mempertimbangkan karier di bidang lain sebelum mereka memasuki pasar kerja.",
  "“Alt academia,” sebut mereka, seolah-olah itu adalah gaya hidup punk dan pemberontak, seolah-olah gagal dalam satu-satunya hal yang telah kau pelajari membuatmu keren.",
  "Tetapi di tengah jalan studinya, Alice merasa bahwa apa pun selain sihir bukanlah pilihan.",
  "Ia menjadi penyihir tetap, atau ia mati.",
  "Ia tidak bisa membayangkan kehidupan lain yang layak dijalani.",
  "",
  "Lagi pula, tidak ada yang benar-benar bersungguh-sungguh ketika mereka mengatakan alt academia sama bergengsinya (atau, yang lebih umum, bahwa tidak ada yang memalukan dari itu).",
  "Mereka bahkan lebih tidak bersungguh-sungguh ketika menekankan bahwa alt academia membayar lebih baik, memiliki jam kerja yang lebih manusiawi, tidak terlalu membuat stres, memberimu jaminan kerja yang lebih baik, membuatmu lebih bahagia.",
  "Oh, para penyihir sangat berhasil di bidang konsultasi, kata mereka.",
  "Perusahaan menyukai keterampilan berpikir kritis dan pemecahan masalah, kata mereka.",
  "Lebih sedikit orang yang mati di industri, kata mereka.",
  "",
  "Aforisme ini diucapkan oleh para profesor tetap yang telah berhasil meraih sukses, yang dengan nyaman tahu bahwa mereka tidak akan pernah menghadapi teror yang kini dihadapi mahasiswa mereka.",
  "“Oh, dia mengambil pekerjaan di industri,” kata mereka, seolah-olah “industri” di sini adalah eufemisme seperti “panti jompo” untuk anjing tua yang sakit.",
  "Dan mereka mengatakannya dengan nada ramah dan merendahkan yang mengkhianati apa yang sebenarnya mereka maksudkan: alt academia berarti kegagalan.",
  "Kehidupan pikiran, yang tidak terikat oleh perdagangan, adalah satu-satunya jenis kehidupan yang layak dijalani.",
  "",
  "Tentu saja orang bisa bertanya mengapa ada yang mau melewati omong kosong seperti itu.",
  "Tetapi di sini, proses berpikir sebagian besar akademisi mencerminkan logika Taruhan Pascal, entah mereka menyadarinya atau tidak.",
  "Taruhan Pascal mengatakan bahwa kau bisa memilih untuk percaya pada Tuhan atau tidak, tetapi jika kau salah bertaruh pada Tuhan dan tidak hidup seolah-olah Ia ada, kau akan kehilangan keajaiban Surga yang tak terbatas.",
  "Demikian pula, kau bisa memilih untuk percaya bahwa pasar kerja akan berpihak padamu atau tidak, tetapi jika kau salah bertaruh dan memilih keluar dari siklus itu, kau akan kehilangan keajaiban tak terbatas dari Kehidupan Pikiran.",
  "Sekarang, seperti dalam kasus Surga, belum ada seorang pun di generasi Alice yang pernah mengalami Kehidupan Pikiran yang Ajaib ini, tetapi semua profesor mereka meyakinkan bahwa itu mungkin terjadi, dan jadilah mereka terus melangkah dengan susah payah.",
  "",
  "Alice juga sudah tahu, sebelum ia mendaftar untuk mengambil PhD dalam sihir analitis di Cambridge, bahwa Profesor Jacob Grimes mungkin bukan pilihan pertama semua orang sebagai pembimbing.",
  "Pembimbing sarjananya di Cornell, seorang sarjana junior yang baik hati bernama Dr. Mills, merasa ragu ketika ia pertama kali menunjukkan daftarnya.",
  "",
  "“Kau tampaknya sangat ingin pergi ke luar negeri,” katanya.",
  "“Yah, di sini mereka telah memecat semua orang Komunis.”",
  "“Cukup adil,” kata Dr. Mills.",
  "“Tetap saja, aku akan memilih Inggris daripada Prancis.",
  "Semuanya tampak cocok kecuali Grimes.”",
  "“Dia yang terbaik di dunia dalam sihir linguistik,” kata Alice.",
  "“Oh, karyanya luar biasa,” kata Dr. Mills.",
  "“Tidak ada yang meragukan itu.",
  "Hanya saja, ada desas-desus bahwa mahasiswa pascasarjananya tidak terlalu, ah, bahagia.”",
  "“Apa artinya itu?”",
  "“Yah—pertama, dia cukup keras pada mereka.",
  "Mereka cenderung cepat kelelahan.",
  "Tingkat kelulusan mahasiswanya tidak terlalu bagus.”",
  "“Seberapa buruk?”",
  "“Kukatakan sekitar setengahnya tidak selesai.”",
  "",
  "Alice, yang sampai saat itu diberkati dengan profesor yang baik dan membantu, tidak tahu seberapa buruk seorang pembimbing bisa jadi.",
  "Ia berpikir, saat itu, bahwa jika kau tidak akur dengan seorang profesor, itu adalah salahmu.",
  "Ia berpikir, sederhana saja, bahwa ia akan memastikan dirinya berada di antara separuh yang berhasil selesai.",
  "",
  "“Tapi aku ingin bekerja dengan yang terbaik di bidang ini,” katanya.",
  "“Aku ingin mendapatkan pekerjaan.”",
  "",
  "Ini, Dr. Mills bisa mengerti.",
  "Pekerjaan bagus di bidang sihir semakin sulit ditemukan.",
  "Setiap mahasiswa sarjana yang lugu ingin menjadi penyihir, tetapi pasarnya sama sekali tidak bagus.",
  "Di kedua sisi Atlantik, kaum konservatif telah berkuasa selama beberapa tahun, dan ini berarti pemotongan dana untuk universitas, departemen yang menyusut, peluang yang menghilang.",
  "Sebagian besar sekolah telah berhenti menawarkan jabatan tetap kepada para penyihir ketika menjadi jelas bahwa para peneliti mereka lebih tertarik pada hal-hal sepele dan esoteris daripada menghasilkan sesuatu yang berguna atau menguntungkan atau setidaknya agak menyerupai senjata nuklir berikutnya.",
  "Ini adalah zaman revolusi teknologi, fisika kuantum dan televisi kabel dengan lebih dari tiga saluran dan komputer pribadi.",
  "Sihir telah tertinggal.",
  "Sihir hanya bagus untuk pesta makan malam.",
  "Sihir tidak membuatmu dipekerjakan.",
  "",
  "Dan tidak ada sihir tanpa akademi.",
  "Universitas menyediakan kapur tulis, silabari, repositori pentagram.",
  "Universitas menerbitkan jurnal, yang menentukan mantra mana yang valid dan mana yang tidak.",
  "Tentu saja ada yang namanya penyihir pinggiran—biasanya mahasiswa PhD yang gagal, mahasiswa magister terminal, atau lulusan sarjana yang tidak pernah masuk ke program pascasarjana sama sekali.",
  "Dan mereka tidak sepenuhnya kekurangan sumber daya—banyak penyihir pinggiran mengumpulkan kapur tulis mereka sendiri, dan menyelenggarakan konferensi amatir, dan menerbitkan di jurnal berperingkat rendah tentang penemuan-penemuan hebat mereka.",
  "Faktanya, beberapa penemuan ini cukup menarik.",
  "Rahasianya, sungguh, adalah bahwa terkadang para penyihir pinggiran menemukan hal-hal yang bahkan tidak bisa dibayangkan oleh profesor tetap.",
  "Tetapi tak satu pun dari itu akan diterbitkan di Arcana, dan karena itu tak satu pun yang memiliki kredibilitas.",
  "",
  "“Aku akan menuliskan rekomendasi terbaik yang kubisa untukmu,” kata Dr. Mills.",
  "“Kau punya peluang bagus di mana pun kau mendaftar—aku akan merasa optimis jika menjadi dirimu.",
  "Tapi berhati-hatilah, Alice.",
  "Pada tahap ini, tampaknya yang terpenting hanyalah diterima.",
  "Namun, ingatlah ada lebih banyak yang dipertaruhkan daripada persetujuan pembimbingmu.",
  "Dan ada lebih banyak hal dalam hidup daripada sihir.”",
  "",
  "Nasihat yang bagus, pikir Alice, dari seorang pria yang sedang dalam perjalanan menuju jabatan tetap.",
  "Ia mengarsipkan kata-kata ini di bawah “kata-kata basa-basi dari orang dewasa yang merasa lebih tahu darimu,” dan kemudian ia segera melupakannya.",
  "",
  "Di Cambridge, peringatan-peringatan itu berlipat ganda.",
  "Mahasiswa pascasarjana, bahkan yang tidak belajar sihir, memberinya tatapan simpatik ketika ia menjelaskan bahwa ia di sini untuk bekerja dengan Grimes.",
  "Anggota fakultas lain berusaha keras untuk bertanya apakah ia baik-baik saja.",
  "Dan kemudian ada satu-satunya mahasiswi bimbingan Profesor Grimes yang lain, Olivia Kincaid, seorang gadis dengan wajah sembap yang sepertinya selalu menangis selama tahun pertama Alice di Cambridge dan kemudian anehnya tidak ada selama tahun keduanya.",
  "Pada tahun ketiga Alice, ketika Olivia seharusnya sudah lulus, ia secara aneh masih mengambil mata kuliah.",
  "",
  "“Dia itu monster,” kata Olivia kepadanya dengan tegas sambil minum bir pada malam pertama mereka bertemu.",
  "“Dia itu sosiopat.”",
  "“Bagaimana bisa?” tanya Alice.",
  "“Kau akan segera tahu,” kata Olivia, dengan samar dan dramatis, yang mendorong Alice untuk menganggapnya sebagai ratu drama.",
  "",
  "Olivia mengambil cuti medis pada tahun keempatnya, kembali selama tiga minggu untuk kuliah, dan kemudian segera menghilang.",
  "Tidak ada seorang pun di departemen yang pernah mendengar kabar darinya lagi.",
  "",
  "Mahasiswa lain menghindar ketika Alice mengungkapkan siapa pembimbingnya, dan ia mengamati ketakutan mereka dengan getaran bangga.",
  "Meskipun ia tidak akan pernah mengakuinya, gagasan bekerja dengan seseorang yang berbahaya menggairahkannya.",
  "Alice telah mempesona semua orang selama bertahun-tahun mengenyam pendidikan tinggi dengan menjadi anak emas guru; dengan secara ajaib berhasil di mana orang lain gagal.",
  "Ia menikmati pikiran bahwa pembimbingnya mungkin keras, tidak sabar, bahkan kejam kepada orang lain—karena itu membuat perhatiannya padanya menjadi lebih berharga.",
  "Ia suka menjadi pengecualian dari aturan.",
  "Favoritisme tidak jadi masalah selama dialah yang jadi favorit.",
  "",
  "Bagaimanapun, kekejaman Profesor Grimes tidaklah acak.",
  "Kau hanya perlu berusaha cukup keras, bekerja keras melewati malam tanpa tidur, untuk memenuhi setiap standar mustahilnya sehingga ia menganggapmu layak dihormati.",
  "Itu adil.",
  "Bukankah begitu cara kerja dunia akademis?",
  "Cara kerja industri kompetitif mana pun?",
  "Mahasiswa terbaik mendapatkan pekerjaan terbaik.",
  "",
  "Alice, selama sebagian besar karier pascasarjananya, menganggap Profesor Grimes sebagai ujian yang perlu dilewati.",
  "Apa yang tidak membunuhmu membuatmu lebih kuat—atau setidaknya memberimu mental yang lebih tangguh.",
  "Hampir sepanjang hidupnya ia menjadi yang pertama di kelasnya, dan ia tidak melihat alasan mengapa PhD harus berbeda.",
  "Ia hanya punya tiga tahun lagi—lalu dua, lalu satu—ia hanya perlu mengusap kantuk dari matanya dan mengambil napas dalam-dalam dan bertahan hidup setiap hari dan mengabaikan setiap kebenaran yang tidak menyenangkan sampai ia mendapatkan ijazahnya, sampai ia bebas.",
  "",
  "Dan ia hampir berhasil juga.",
  "Itulah yang membuat seluruh kekacauan ini jauh lebih membuat frustrasi.",
  "Anak tangganya nyaris bertahan.",
  "Ia hampir selamat dari apa yang tidak seorang pun percaya bisa ia lewati, hampir merasakan ganjarannya.",
  "Andai saja ia bertahan sedikit lebih lama.",
  "Ia sudah begitu, begitu dekat."

  "Dan mengapa baik visi Yunani maupun Mesopotamia tentang akhirat melibatkan sistem keadilan, penjaga gerbang, dan akuntan yang rapi dan teratur, dipersenjatai dengan catatan dan timbangan, memproses antrean orang mati dengan cara yang sama seperti kantor paspor memproses warga negara.",
  "Pada akhirnya, manusia lebih menyukai tatanan yang dapat diprediksi dari birokrasi yang mereka kenal.",

  "Delapan Pengadilan Neraka bukanlah arena hukuman abadi.",
  "Pertama, hal ini akan sangat tidak adil.",
  "Tidak ada dosa, sekeji apa pun, yang pantas mendapatkan hukuman selamanya.",
  "Itu tidak proporsional; secara matematis tidak masuk akal.",
  "Kedua, alam semesta membutuhkan keseimbangan.",
  "Seperti yang dikatakan Socrates, “Jika yang hidup dilahirkan dari dunia lain, dan yang hidup terus-menerus mati, apa yang akan mencegah segalanya habis ditelan kematian?”",
  "Dalam hal kematian, orang-orang Kristen benar tentang keabadian jiwa tetapi salah tentang yang lainnya.",
  "Di sini, kaum Pythagorean, Platonis, Buddha dan Taois, Manichaean, Jain dan Sikh serta Hindu, memiliki pemahaman yang lebih baik.",
  "Hidup dan mati adalah dua sisi dari mata uang yang sama.",
  "Lebih masuk akal untuk mengonsepkan jiwa sebagai sesuatu yang terus-menerus mengalir dari satu dunia ke dunia lain daripada berpikir bahwa semua yang pernah hidup selamanya menumpuk di sebuah makam dunia bawah.",
  "",
  "Pada tahun 1960-an, filsuf Michael Huemer memperdebatkan kemungkinan reinkarnasi berdasarkan probabilitas yang kini telah diterima oleh sebagian besar sarjana.",
  "Menurut Huemer, kita punya alasan untuk percaya bahwa waktu terbentang tanpa batas ke masa lalu dan ke masa depan.",
  "Jika waktu tak terbatas, kemungkinan bahwa satu-satunya masa hidup kita terjadi pada saat ini, pada titik kecil di garis waktu ini, mendekati nol.",
  "Jadi, entah waktu itu terbatas, atau kita hidup lebih dari satu kali.",
  "Huemer berpendapat setidaknya masuk akal bahwa masa lalu tidak terbatas, jadi kita memiliki bukti yang cukup untuk percaya pada pengulangan abadi.",
  "Para teolog dan sarjana studi agama tidak menyukai argumen ini karena alasan yang sama mereka tidak menyukai Taruhan Pascal, yaitu karena argumen tersebut tampaknya mengambil jalan pintas matematis untuk mencapai kesimpulan yang membutuhkan ribuan tahun untuk diartikulasikan oleh agama.",
  "",
  "Para penyihir menyukainya.",
  "",
  "Teori reinkarnasi sangat selaras dengan teori pengulangan abadi, sebuah gagasan yang diusung oleh Friedrich Nietzsche dan kaum Pythagorean.",
  "Secara umum, pengulangan abadi berpendapat bahwa peristiwa-peristiwa di alam semesta ditakdirkan—atau dikutuk—untuk berulang lagi dan lagi, karena ada jumlah energi dan materi yang terbatas di alam semesta yang tak terbatas, dalam rentang waktu yang tak terbatas, dan kombinasi interaksi mereka juga terbatas.",
  "Jam pasir abadi keberadaan, ibaratnya, berbalik lagi dan lagi.",
  "Kita dilahirkan kembali untuk mengalir bersama pasir.",
  "",
  "Sayangnya, konsensus para sarjana hanya sampai di sini.",
  "Para Tartarolog sangat berbeda pendapat tentang cara kerja reinkarnasi.",
  "Berapa lama seseorang harus menunggu sebelum dilahirkan kembali?",
  "Apakah kelahiran kembali bersifat kekeluargaan—apakah nenekmu yang sudah meninggal menjadi putrimu?",
  "Apakah kebaikan dan keburukan karma terakumulasi dari waktu ke waktu, sehingga orang yang berbudi luhur menjalani kehidupan yang semakin baik?",
  "Bisakah seseorang lolos dari siklus reinkarnasi, seperti yang diharapkan umat Buddha?",
  "Bisakah jiwa manusia dilahirkan kembali ke dalam tubuh hewan?",
  "Lagi pula, apakah hewan punya jiwa?",
  "Kita tahu ingatan dibersihkan di antara kehidupan, karena tidak ada catatan siapa pun yang secara kredibel mengingat kehidupan masa lalunya.",
  "Sangat sedikit hal lain yang kita ketahui secara pasti.",
  "",
  "Yang paling membingungkan dari semuanya adalah pertanyaan tentang hukuman.",
  "Apa tujuannya?",
  "Apakah bersifat rehabilitatif—haruskah kita menderita hanya sampai kita belajar dari kesalahan?",
  "Apakah bersifat retributif—haruskah kita menyeimbangkan neraca karma, kehilangan mata ganti mata, dan menderita sebanyak penderitaan yang kita sebabkan?",
  "Berapa jam di dalam lubang air mendidih yang setara dengan sebuah pembunuhan?",
  "Apakah hukuman adalah bentuk contrapasso, seperti yang digambarkan Dante, di mana hukuman muncul dari sifat dosa itu sendiri dan mewakili kebalikan puitis dari perbuatan salah?",
  "Apakah hukuman memerlukan universalisasi maksim yang dilanggar, seperti teori Kant?",
  "Apakah Neraka adalah satu manifestasi metafisik besar dari Aturan Emas?",
  "",
  "Satu-satunya hal yang kita ketahui secara pasti adalah bahwa jiwa-jiwa di Dunia Bawah pada akhirnya melakukan perjalanan, dalam wujud apa pun, ke wilayah Dewa Yama—yaitu, Hades, Anubis, Raja Orang Mati, Penguasa Dunia Bawah, Hakim Kehidupan dan Kematian, atau bagaimana pun orang ingin memandangnya.",
  "Seperti banyak konsep dalam sihir, Dewa Yama lebih didefinisikan oleh ketiadaan bukti daripada bukti itu sendiri.",
  "Ia adalah sebuah konsep yang mewakili apa yang tidak kita ketahui.",
  "Ia bisa jadi agen rasional, adil dan bijaksana, seorang raja-filsuf di alam ktonik.",
  "Ia bisa jadi iblis, tidak stabil dan berubah-ubah.",
  "Ia bisa jadi divinitas yang tak terindra, yang dalam lingkaran ini adalah kode untuk “belum ada yang menerbitkan makalah tentang ini.”",
  "",
  "Terlepas dari semua teori, cerita, dan mitos kita, rancangan Dewa Yama tetap menjadi misteri total.",
  "Tidak ada yang tahu pasti apa yang sebenarnya terjadi di pengadilan-pengadilan itu, atau mengapa; apalagi para Shade di dalamnya.",
  "Jika ini adalah ujian, tidak ada yang tahu cara melewatinya.",
  "Jika ini hanyalah siksaan, tidak ada yang tahu berapa lama akan berlangsung.",
  "Seseorang tidak dapat mengantisipasi, berbuat curang, atau menemukan jalan pintas melalui penebusan.",
  "Kita menyeberangi Lethe dan bereinkarnasi kapan pun Neraka menganggap kita siap.",

  "",
  "“What’s everyone researching?”",
  "",
  "“Oh.” Annoyance crossed his face.",
  "“Freshly dead, then?”",
  "",
  "“Actually, we’re—” Alice began, but Peter cut her off.",
  "",
  "“Yes,” he said.",
  "“Just got here, and very confused.",
  "What’re you reading for?”",
  "",
  "The Shade pointed to a brass plaque on a wall behind him.",
  "It read, in big serif font, DEFINE THE GOOD.",
  "",
  "“I don’t understand,” said Peter.",
  "",
  "“Just what it says.” The Shade waved his hand impatiently.",
  "“Figure it out, give an oral defense, and they pass you through.”",
  "",
  "“Figure what out, though?”",
  "",
  "“Law, look.” Peter picked a printed sheet off the table.",
  "Alice glanced over his shoulder.",
  "It was titled “Recommended Reading,” followed by a list of authors.",
  "Immanuel Kant.",
  "Jeremy Bentham.",
  "Herbert Spencer.",
  "“Oh, look.",
  "Nietzsche.”",
  "",
  "Alice ignored him.",
  "“What do you mean, pass through?” she asked the Shade.",
  "“Who passes you?",
  "How long does that take?”",
  "",
  "“Christ,” said the Shade.",
  "“Do I look like your tutor?”",
  "",
  "The Shade turned his back to her, pressing his face determinedly against his magnifying glass.",
  "",
  "“Let’s walk a bit,” Peter suggested, gently tugging Alice away.",
  "“See if there’s a floor plan, or a librarian deity, maybe.”",
  "",
  "They wove round and round the maze of shelves, dodging irritable Shades, until they came upon an area that seemed like a main lobby.",
  "The stacks stretched radially from a circular study zone, and the ceiling opened to reveal a great central staircase.",
  "They looked up.",
  "The staircase went on and on, adorned at every floor by great bronze statues in various postures of deep thinking.",
  "The library had seemed finite from the outside—Alice was sure she’d seen the roof of the tower—but from within it stretched onward as far as the eye could see, floors spiraling toward an ever-tinier center, and Shades moving busily all throughout.",
  "",
  "Like all good scholars Alice sometimes had fantasies of an infinite library, a Borgian Library of Babel in which one could be forever lost.",
  "But this sight now gave her stabs of panic.",
  "It was so vast.",
  "And they had no time.",
  "Professor Grimes was moving with purpose, the Shade at the wall had said.",
  "He was bent on getting through, and when Grimes was bent on something it was like walls did not exist.",
  "They had to reach him before he reincarnated; they could not dally.",
  "",
  "“Gosh.” Peter looked similarly helpless.",
  "“Should we just split up and search one by one?”",
  "",
  "“That could take forever.”",
  "",
  "“But maybe there’s some order,” said Peter.",
  "“Could be it’s chronological, could be more recent arrivals are near the bottom.”",
  "",
  "“Hold on.” Alice rubbed her temples.",
  "“Let’s just—give me a second to think.”",
  "",
  "Pride, superbia, arrogance.",
  "Hubris, the defiance of gods; māna, the puffed-up mind.",
  "None of the sojourners’ accounts said anything about a university library, and so she had to return to first principles, philosophical basics.",
  "She riffled through texts, images, treatises, that resided in her mind.",
  "Icarus, hurtling from the sky; Arachne, limbs splitting into eight.",
  "What was pride?",
  "For Augustine, the original sin; for Pope Gregory, the root of all evil.",
  "For Plato, the First Court punished those possessed of a timocratic soul—the soul who purported to love justice and honor and beauty, but who cared more about preserving the appearance of such things rather than making the sacrifices necessary to fulfill those things themselves.",
  "For Confucius, the Court of Pride housed the xiaoren, the petty men, who chased the names of things but not their nature.",
  "A mismatch between the name and the thing—yes, that was it, the common thread running through all these theories.",
  "But what did all this have to do with defining the good?",
  "And how did one go about defining the good?",
  "If she just could figure this out, then she could retrace Professor Grimes’s path, for he surely would have cracked this in an instant.",
  "",
  "But she found it so hard to think.",
  "Her thoughts kept flying away from her even as she tried her best to sort through what she knew.",
  "The library no longer seemed quite so hallowed.",
  "Noises kept crowding her mind—bickering, whispering, scratching, coughing, breathing, pens scratching, pens clicking—none of it above an atypical volume, but it was all so blindingly present, harsh to distraction.",
  "And someone the next shelf over kept moaning, an insufferable sound that grew louder and louder.",
  "",
  "She whirled round the shelf.",
  "“For heaven’s sake!”",
  "",
  "It was the Shade of a young man, skinny and long limbed, hunched on the floor with his knees drawn to his chest as he rocked back and forth.",
  "He had the look of a law student, though Alice couldn’t say why; she just felt this was the case.",
  "Something about his chin.",
  "Books lay scattered all around him, and streaks of spilled ink marred the carpet.",
  "At the sight of Alice and Peter, he wailed even louder.",
  "“They won’t pass me.",
  "Seventeen times, seventeen times and they still won’t pass me, I’m such an idiot . . . ”",
  "",
  "“Oh, no, no.” Alice was sorry she had snapped.",
  "She was familiar with sights like this, and normally when people had mental breakdowns in the college library you spoke to them in a soft, calming voice and confiscated all the sharp items on the table and sent them off for a biscuit and a nap.",
  "“You’re not an idiot.”",
  "",
  "“But I’ve done everything,” hiccupped the Shade.",
  "“Read all the recommended texts.",
  "Read Russell, for Christ’s sake.”",
  "He smacked his palm against the side of his head.",
  "“I even followed the regimen in The Republic.",
  "I studied mathematics—oh!”",
  "",
  "He slumped sideways and knocked against the table leg, which sent a stack of notes cascading across the floor.",
  "At this, he made a keening noise and rolled forward onto his hands and knees.",
  "“And now my notes are out of order.”",
  "",
  "Peter knelt down to help him collect them.",
  "“Here—”",
  "The young Shade clutched them to his chest.",
  "“They’re color-coded,” he wailed.",
  "“Not that they care.”",
  "",
  "“Werner, please.” A second Shade, a shorter and older-looking fellow, hurried down the aisle toward them.",
  "He placed his hands under Werner’s armpits and, grunting, hauled him upright.",
  "“We have talked about this.",
  "You may not have mental breakdowns in the stacks.”",
  "",
  "“They failed me again,” sobbed Werner.",
  "“They hate me.”",
  "",
  "“Yes, I know.” The older Shade patted him on the cheeks.",
  "“But pull yourself together, please.",
  "There’ve been noise complaints.”",
  "",
  "“I’ll never get out . . . ”",
  "",
  "“Crying fits are to be conducted in private, that’s library rules.” The older Shade clapped him on the back.",
  "“I’ve booked you a place.",
  "Study room C-56.",
  "Third floor.",
  "Go on.”",
  "",
  "Werner, still weeping into his hands, stumbled obediently off toward the staircase.",
  "",
  "“Good man.” The older Shade dusted off his palms, then turned to Alice and Peter.",
  "“So very sorry, won’t happen again—why, you look new!",
  "Just arrived?”",
  "",
  "“Yes indeed,” said Alice.",
  "",
  "“Double suicide,” Peter added, which Alice found rather dramatic but did not challenge.",
  "",
  "“You’re remarkably well-presenting!” The Shade brushed the back of his hand across Peter’s shoulder.",
  "“The stitching on your collar.",
  "Incredible.",
  "How do you manage?”",
  "",
  "“Er,” said Peter.",
  "“I really try?”",
  "",
  "“It’s quite magnificent!",
  "You wouldn’t believe the laziness that passes here.",
  "Most new arrivals don’t even bother with a face.” The Shade bowed low before them, hands clasped as if in prayer.",
  "“George Edward Moore.",
  "At your service.”",
  "",
  "He was the most human-looking Shade Alice had seen thus far, which was to say that every part of him was richly detailed and solid, from the gray wisps atop his head to the scuffed tips of his leather shoes.",
  "He had the slightly lopsided smile of lifelong pipe smokers—and yes, there it was, a pipe hanging from his left hand.",
  "This he waved in their direction.",
  "“And you are . . . ?”",
  "",
  "“Peter Murdoch.” They answered both at once.",
  "“Alice Law.”",
  "",
  "“And where did you study, Peter Murdoch?”",
  "",
  "“Oh, I’m—we’re at Cambridge,” said Peter.",
  "“Department of—”",
  "",
  "“Ah, Cambridge!” Moore grasped Peter’s hand and shook vigorously.",
  "Alice he ignored.",
  "“A Cambridge man!",
  "What wonderful news.",
  "I was at Trinity myself.",
  "Come, come.",
  "Let me give you the tour.”",
  "",
  "He set off for the staircase.",
  "Alice glanced to Peter, who shrugged as if to say, Why not?",
  "",
  "No better options presented themselves, and Moore did not look obviously dangerous—in any case Alice did not know of any demonic entity calling itself George Edward Moore—so they fell into step.",
  "Moore, turning, gestured magnanimously toward the first floor.",
  "",
  "“Now, the floors alternate between workspaces and stacks.",
  "Stacks are organized in ascending order chronologically by century, and then alphabetically within discipline.",
  "It is a bit complicated, but I do recommend starting at the sixth century BC and working your way up.” Moore paused, overlooking the first floor, which was indeed composed of busy study tables and endless hallways of study rooms.",
  "“You’ll find it a shock at first, being newly deceased and all, but there are no bathroom facilities or kitchens.",
  "No one needs to sleep or eat.",
  "They are freed to engage full-time in their work.”",
  "",
  "“Defining the good,” supplied Peter.",
  "",
  "“Quite right.",
  "So the plaques tell us.",
  "That’s the only rule of this place: figure out the meaning of the good.",
  "When someone comes up with a definition they like, they go out to the shore for an oral defense.",
  "If they pass, they cross on.",
  "If they fail—well, you saw poor Werner.” Moore nodded over the dozens of toiling Shades.",
  "“Most have been at it for years.",
  "Look at them go.”",
  "",
  "Alice felt the twitch of an impulse to join them.",
  "Not because the project sounded so interesting—in fact it sounded overly vague and a little annoying—but because there was pleasure in being handed a simple, defined task and pursuing it with vigor.",
  "All those Shades looked so diligent and purposeful, which seemed somehow virtuous.",
  "It was always good to be engaged in research.",
  "As Aristotle put it, complete happiness was some form of study.",
  "",
  "“But that doesn’t seem so difficult,” said Peter.",
  "",
  "“That’s what you think.”",
  "",
  "“But isn’t it just like—you know, good things?”",
  "",
  "“Ah,” said Moore.",
  "“But that’s a tautology.”",
  "",
  "“Happiness, then,” said Peter.",
  "“And justice.",
  "And kindness, and . . . ”",
  "",
  "“You’re just saying synonyms now.”",
  "",
  "“But surely they’re all parts of the good—”",
  "",
  "“Oh, so there is a complete list?",
  "And what else qualifies for your list?",
  "What is the common quality of all virtues on your list?",
  "Can you give me a comprehensive, tightly defined version of your list?”",
  "",
  "Peter paused.",
  "“I see.”",
  "",
  "“It’s harder than you think.” Moore smiled.",
  "“Everyone comes in believing they already know the answer, and they fail many times before they turn to the literature.",
  "And now the really severe cases, they never make any progress at all and then they end up bronzing—”",
  "",
  "“Bronzing?” Peter repeated.",
  "",
  "“A terrible affliction.",
  "Starts in your feet, and then you can’t move, and then you’re stuck where you are.",
  "We move them to the pedestals when that happens.",
  "Look, there’s Newton.”",
  "",
  "Alice had been leaning on a plinth; she flinched back.",
  "“These statues are people?”",
  "",
  "“Yes indeed, every one.” Moore knocked his knuckles against a plinth that read, Galileo.",
  "He continued up toward the second floor.",
  "“They do wake up, though who knows after how long.",
  "Between you and me I think they like it in there—they get a break from the work, and everyone has to marvel at them.”",
  "",
  "“So what puts in you in this court?” asked Alice.",
  "“I mean, what’s everyone in for?”",
  "",
  "“Don’t ask!",
  "You’re not supposed to ask, that’s the first rule you’ve got to learn.",
  "It is considered very rude.” Moore lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper.",
  "“Though rumors travel, of course.",
  "People get distracted and leave their transcripts where anyone can see.” He pointed.",
  "“For instance, that fellow there—he told everyone he taught at Oxford, where really he taught at Oxford Brookes.”",
  "",
  "“That’s enough to put you in Pride?”",
  "",
  "“Oh, yes.",
  "You wouldn’t believe the sort we get in here.” Moore kept pointing as they walked.",
  "“That one there, he rejected submissions if they hadn’t cited his own work.",
  "",
  "“That one gave eighty-two presentations on Goethe.",
  "",
  "“That one likes to remind folks that Dartmouth is in the Ivy League.",
  "",
  "“And over there—creative writing students.” This was said in reference to a study room of eight Shades, all glowering at one another in silence.",
  "“Somehow they always come in groups.",
  "Can’t understand why.”",
  "",
  "They passed another study room, where one Shade was droning on to another in a very loud voice, “. . . of course, it’s all very Derridean, which I am uncomfortable with because of Derrida’s obsession with feces.",
  "Did you know I saw Derrida speak at a conference once?",
  "All anyone could talk about was how he got high on LSD and smeared feces all over the walls.”",
  "",
  "“Continental philosophers.” Moore shuddered.",
  "“Here we have dozens.”",
  "",
  "The procession of petty sins continued as they circled up the floors.",
  "Moore seemed to delight very much in explicating the moral failure of his fellow residents, for his hushed whispers nevertheless carried over the floors, eliciting the occasional peeved glare.",
  "“Now, that one self-published self-help productivity books.",
  "",
  "“Calls himself a Communist, but hasn’t read Das Kapital.",
  "",
  "“Recites pi to show off.",
  "",
  "“Had more of a comment, not a question.",
  "",
  "“Wouldn’t accept papers written in the first person.",
  "",
  "“Turned his exam papers over very loudly.",
  "",
  "“Still asks people what they got on their A-levels.",
  "",
  "“Still tells people what he got on his A-levels.",
  "",
  "“Made his wife call him Doctor.",
  "He’s a medievalist, mind you.",
  "",
  "“Now, that one keeps saying he went to school in Boston and expecting everyone to know what he means.",
  "Every few years the other Shades gang up on him and brick him up behind the stacks.”",
  "",
  "They passed a series of rooms overflowing with texts.",
  "“Book hoarders,” Moore explained.",
  "",
  "“Why would you hoard books in a library?”",
  "",
  "“To prove that you’ve found them,” said Moore.",
  "“To prove you know of them.",
  "To prove you have proximity to them.",
  "But reading them, that’s too much.”",
  "",
  "At this point Alice had made up her mind Professor Grimes could not have been sentenced to Pride.",
  "She felt indignant, actually, at the thought of this gossipy little man lumping Grimes in with these posers and imposters.",
  "Yes, Professor Grimes was occasionally very rude; yes, the whole Royal Academy called him arrogant behind his back; yes, he habitually reduced undergraduates to tears.",
  "But weren’t all great thinkers of their generation a little prickly?",
  "And hadn’t he earned his prickle?",
  "She recalled that Aristotle distinguished between proper and improper pride.",
  "The worthy man could justly boast of his accomplishments, so long as he had actually done them.",
  "Professor Grimes could only be charged with behaving as befit his station, which was lofty, and Alice really did not think this was as morally egregious as calling oneself a Marxist.",
  "",
  "Anyhow, Professor Grimes hated peacocking.",
  "She knew this because once she had been caught up with the thrill of competition herself.",
  "At her first conference—after a dizzying night of cocktails with students from Oxford and London, all comparing the sizes of their stipends, their research budgets, who had recently published where—she had gone up to Professor Grimes in the hotel lobby and blustered, drunk on superiority, “Can you believe they don’t have a proseminar at Imperial?”",
  "She had thought he might laugh, that they could share this condescension.",
  "But he had looked down at her with such blistering disdain.",
  "“Don’t play stupid games, Law.”",
  "",
  "Peter was there; he snickered.",
  "And Alice spent the night in red-faced shame.",
  "",
  "It was a lesson worth learning.",
  "She had not repeated this mistake.",
  "Those who had nothing substantial to brag about bragged the loudest.",
  "Stay silent and ignore the chattering crowd—this was proof you had something real to be proud of.",
  "",
  "She fell back so she could speak to Peter.",
  "Moore did not notice.",
  "He had worked himself up into a rant about psychoanalysts, and his arms flapped so vehemently that should Alice and Peter have kept pace, he might have whacked them in the face.",
  "",
  "“He’s not here,” she murmured.",
  "“Let’s go.”",
  "",
  "“What are you talking about?”",
  "",
  "“It’s a waste of time.” Her irritation had sharpened to urgency.",
  "Every minute spent here was a minute in which Professor Grimes pushed further into Hell.",
  "“And Moore said we were the first from Cambridge in years, so he would have met him—”",
  "",
  "“Well, maybe they didn’t cross paths.”",
  "",
  "“Then let’s ditch him and search on our own.",
  "He’s a clown—”",
  "",
  "“He’s not so bad.”",
  "",
  "“He’s a petty gossip!”",

  "He gestured to a door.",
  "“Here we are.",
  "My office.",
  "Do come in.”",
  "",
  "Alice had seen offices like Moore’s many times before.",
  "They were offices of decadent accretion, offices of men who had earned tenure back when earning tenure just involved being friends with the department head and who treated their space like a clubhouse until they grew old enough the university could boot them out.",
  "A massive, cluttered desk; plump armchairs; porcelain tea sets; memorabilia from trips to Asia and Africa—where Moore had found a Turkish carpet in the Underworld, Alice had no idea.",
  "Books overflowed from the shelves, lay scattered in piles on the floor and the desk.",
  "These included, she noticed, the aforementioned copy of Meditations.",
  "Framed diplomas hung on every wall—from where, Alice had no idea, because she was not aware of any degree-granting accredited institutions in Hell.",

  "“Please, please.” Moore ushered them in.",
  "“My little sanctuary.",

  "Alice and Peter sat gingerly on the couch, while Moore bustled around his desk, muttering things like “If I’d known I’d have company . . .” and “Pardon the mess.”",

  "“There we go!” He turned round and offered them a tobacco tin.",
  "“Smoke?”",
  "",
  "They both shook their heads.",
  "Shrugging, Moore packed his own pipe, lit it, and sucked in with great relish.",
  "He exhaled.",
  "Thick smoke wafted into their faces.",

  "Paleontologist.",
  "Wouldn’t stop dusting at the floors trying to find ammonites.",

  "Tidak ada pohon atau rumput hijau, karena tidak ada yang tumbuh di sini, tapi itu tidak apa-apa; lumpur diatur dengan cara yang elegan.",
  "Secara keseluruhan, Neraka saat ini cukup menyenangkan.",

  "Udara sedikit terlalu dingin, seperti di semua perpustakaan universitas, tapi sebaliknya cukup nyaman.",

  "Icarus, jatuh dari langit; Arachne, anggota tubuhnya terbelah menjadi delapan.",
  "Apa itu kesombongan?",
  "Bagi Augustinus, dosa asal; bagi Paus Gregorius, akar segala kejahatan.",
  "Bagi Plato, Pengadilan Pertama menghukum mereka yang memiliki jiwa timokratis—jiwa yang mengaku mencintai keadilan, kehormatan, dan keindahan, tapi lebih peduli menjaga penampilan hal-hal tersebut daripada membuat pengorbanan yang diperlukan untuk memenuhi hal-hal itu sendiri.",
  "Bagi Konfusius, Pengadilan Kesombongan menampung xiaoren, orang-orang kecil, yang mengejar nama-nama sesuatu tetapi bukan hakikatnya.",

  "Ia mengingat bahwa Aristoteles membedakan antara kesombongan yang pantas dan tidak pantas.",
  "Orang yang layak bisa dengan adil membanggakan pencapaiannya, selama ia benar-benar telah melakukannya.",
  "Profesor Grimes hanya bisa dituduh berperilaku sesuai dengan kedudukannya, yang tinggi, dan Alice benar-benar tidak berpikir ini sama buruknya secara moral seperti menyebut diri sebagai Marxis.",
  "",
  "Bagaimanapun, Profesor Grimes membenci pamer.",
  "Ia tahu ini karena sekali ia terbawa oleh sensasi kompetisi sendiri.",
  "Di konferensi pertamanya—setelah malam yang memusingkan dengan koktail bersama mahasiswa dari Oxford dan London, semua membandingkan besarnya dana penelitian mereka, anggaran penelitian mereka, siapa yang baru saja menerbitkan di mana—ia mendatangi Profesor Grimes di lobi hotel dan berkata dengan sombong, mabuk superioritas, “Bisa percaya mereka tidak punya proseminar di Imperial?”",
  "Ia pikir Grimes mungkin akan tertawa, bahwa mereka bisa berbagi sikap merendahkan ini.",
  "Tapi ia memandangnya dengan tatapan menghina yang membakar.",
  "“Jangan mainkan permainan bodoh, Law.”",
  "",
  "Peter ada di sana; ia terkekeh.",
  "Dan Alice menghabiskan malam dengan wajah merah karena malu.",
  "",
  "Itu pelajaran yang layak dipelajari.",
  "Ia tidak mengulangi kesalahan ini.",

  "Tetap diam dan abaikan kerumunan yang berisik—ini bukti kamu punya sesuatu yang nyata untuk dibanggakan.",
  "",
  "Ia mundur agar bisa berbicara dengan Peter.",
  "Moore tidak menyadari.",
  "Ia telah terbawa dalam omelannya tentang psikoanalis, dan lengannya bergerak begitu hebat sehingga jika Alice dan Peter tetap sejajar, ia mungkin akan memukul wajah mereka.",
  "",
  "“Dia tidak di sini,” gumamnya.",
  "“Ayo pergi.”",
  "",
  "“Apa yang kamu bicarakan?”",
  "",
  "“Ini buang-buang waktu.” Kekesalannya telah berubah menjadi urgensi.",
  "Setiap menit yang dihabiskan di sini adalah menit di mana Profesor Grimes semakin jauh masuk ke Neraka.",
  "“Dan Moore bilang kami adalah yang pertama dari Cambridge dalam bertahun-tahun, jadi ia pasti sudah bertemu dengannya—”",

  "Ia menunjuk ke sebuah pintu.",
  "“Kita sampai.",
  "Kantorku.",
  "Silakan masuk.”",

  "Alice pernah melihat kantor seperti milik Moore berkali-kali sebelumnya.",
  "Mereka adalah kantor-kantor akresi yang dekaden, kantor-kantor pria yang mendapatkan tenur ketika mendapatkan tenur hanya melibatkan berteman dengan kepala departemen dan yang memperlakukan ruang mereka seperti klub hingga mereka cukup tua sehingga universitas bisa mengusir mereka.",
  "Meja besar yang penuh sesak; kursi berlengan empuk; set teh porselen; suvenir dari perjalanan ke Asia dan Afrika—dari mana Moore menemukan karpet Turki di Dunia Bawah, Alice tidak tahu.",
  "Buku-buku meluber dari rak, berserakan dalam tumpukan di lantai dan meja.",
  "Ini termasuk, ia perhatikan, salinan Meditations yang disebutkan sebelumnya.",
  "Diploma berbingkai tergantung di setiap dinding—dari mana, Alice tidak tahu, karena ia tidak tahu ada institusi terakreditasi yang memberikan gelar di Neraka.",

  "“Rokok?”",

  "“Orang terakhir yang punya nama besar yang datang adalah pria Durham,” ia memberitahu Peter.",
  "“Dan sekarang, aku memang punya standar, ya, tapi bertahun-tahun kesepian dan aku pikir, Durham, baiklah, kita bisa bekerja dengan itu.",
  "Tapi dia sangat membosankan.",
  "Paleontolog.",
  "Tidak berhenti menyapu lantai mencoba menemukan amonit.",

  "“Dan siapa mereka itu?”",
  "",
  "“Para dewa, tentu saja.",
  "Niutou dan Mamian.",
  "Kepala Sapi dan Wajah Kuda, penyeimbang karma, tangan kanan dan kiri Lord Yama yang Adil.” Semua ini Moore ucapkan seperti anak sekolah yang membaca kitab suci.",
  "“Mereka tidak banyak bicara, tapi mereka bisa memahami hatimu dalam sekejap.",
  "Kalian bisa memohon sebanyak yang kalian suka, tapi jika transkrip kalian tidak lengkap, mereka selalu tahu.",
  "Jika transkrip kalian menyebut kesombongan, maka kalian harus lulus Kesombongan.”",

  "Tidak mungkin hilang.” Ia mengangguk ke selembar kertas yang tergeletak menghadap ke bawah di mejanya.",
  "“Bagaimanapun, kalian mendapat tanda di transkrip kalian seiring berjalannya waktu, kalian tahu.",
  "Transkrip mencantumkan dosa-dosa besar kalian, dan kemudian kalian harus melakukannya secara berurutan.",
  "Lulus Kesombongan dan kalian masuk Keinginan, lulus Keinginan dan kalian masuk Ketamakan . . .”",
  "",
  "“Lalu bagaimana jika kami selesai di Kesombongan?” Alice terus mendesak.",
  "“Jika kami tidak bersalah di Keinginan, atau Ketamakan?",

  "Apa yang akan dilakukan Niutou dan Mamian saat itu?”",
  "",
  "“Ah.",
  "Ya.” Moore bersandar ke belakang.",
  "“Yah, konon mereka datang menjemput kalian dengan kapal.",
  "Pintu-pintu besar di lobi itu menuju ke pasir, kalian tahu.",
  "Dan lewat pasir, sungai.",
  "Konon kalian melihat kapal emas besar di cakrawala.",
  "Konon itu meluncur di atas air gelap dan mengulurkan papan ke pantai.",
  "Mereka akan menunggu kalian di sana.",
  "Mereka akan membantu kalian naik.”",
  "",
  "“Lalu apa?”",
  "",
  "“Dan kemudian mereka menawarkan minuman Lethe, yang diseduh oleh Nyonya Meng Po sendiri.” Mata Moore menjadi jauh.",
  "Senyum miring itu merosot dari wajahnya.",
  "“Konon rasanya seperti bunga dandelion, seperti embun di pagi hari.",
  "Kalian minum.",
  "Kenangan kalian dihapus dari jiwa kalian, seperti debu dari perapian.",
  "Kalian hanyalah debu bintang, seperti dulu sebelumnya.",
  "Segar.",
  "Bersih.",
  "Dan kalian kemudian diangkut ke pengadilan Lord Yama, untuk melewati Gerbang Reinkarnasi untuk kembali berkelana ke ruang fana merah itu, untuk bergoyang di antara debu.",

  "“Apa?",

  "“Ini materi yang sangat padat, etika.",
  "Cukup mustahil untuk dikuasai.",
  "Tidak, belum ada jiwa yang diundang untuk menyeberangi Lethe selama aku di sini.",
  "Bahkan aku—” Moore berhenti, meringis.",
  "Ia menghisap lagi cerutunya.",

  "“Mengapa, dilema klasik.” Moore merentangkan tangannya.",
  "“Administrasi mengganggu penelitian.",
  "Aku agak seperti dekan di sini, kalau kamu belum perhatikan.",
  "Bayangan di sini berperilaku sangat buruk.",
  "Menimbun teks.",
  "Mencuri catatan satu sama lain.",

  "",
  "“Maaf?”",

  "“Ada kantor kosong di ujung lorong, kita akan menyiapkannya dalam waktu singkat, aku punya karpet dan furnitur cadangan.",

  "“Tapi kalian tidak bisa pergi.” Moore berdiri.",
  "Ia mengembuskan napas perlahan, dan asap yang keluar dari mulutnya membentuk awan ungu tebal yang menggumpal dan menggantung cukup mencolok di depan pintu.",

  "Asap terus mengalir dari pipa Moore.",
  "",
  "Mereka bertiga berdiri, saling memandang.",
  "Alice kemudian teringat bahwa sangat sedikit dari pria perokok pipa yang ramah di perguruan tinggi yang benar-benar ramah sepenuhnya.",
  "Sikap dan senyum selalu merupakan lapisan untuk sesuatu yang agak busuk.",
  "Biasanya misogini kuno yang baik.",
  "Rasisme di hari yang baik.",
  "Kesombongan dalam kebanyakan kasus.",
  "Kadang-kadang demensia.",
  "Banyak pria tua di Ruang Bersama Senior yang menuntut kamu membantu menemukan kacamata mereka, dan juga menjelaskan apa yang dimaksud dengan semua orang kulit berwarna itu.",
  "Dalam kasus ini, yang tersembunyi di baliknya adalah tatapan kosong dan mata lebar yang tampak sangat kesepian, dan sangat gila.",

  "",
  "“Bagaimana ini,” katanya.",
  "“Jika kamu bisa membuktikan kepada kami bahwa kami harus tinggal di sini, maka kami akan tinggal.",
  "Jika kamu tidak bisa, maka kamu membiarkan kami pergi.",

  "",
  "“Cukup mudah,” dengus Moore.",

  "",
  "“Bukankah kita semua,” kata Alice.",
  "“Pecah argumen itu menjadi dua premis dan satu kesimpulan.",

  "“Baiklah,” kata Alice.",

  "“Aku akan menjelaskannya untukmu.",
  "A, kamu hanya bisa meninggalkan Kesombongan setelah lulus.",
  "B, kamu belum lulus.",
  "C, kamu harus mengikuti aturan Neraka.",
  "Dan kemudian kamu hanya menambahkan premis lain, D—” Ia menghentikan diri sendiri, dan bergumam sesuatu yang terdengar seperti, “Tidak, lalu kita harus menambahkan E . . . tapi untuk membuat orang-orang bodoh itu menerima kesimpulan E, sangat sederhana, kita harus menambahkan F . . .”",

  "Alice menarik lengan Peter.",
  "“Ayo pergi.”",

  "Mereka bergegas menuruni tangga dan kembali ke lobi, melewati rak-rak buku yang berderit dan berdecit, lampu belajar yang berkedip, kelompok belajar yang bertengkar, dan Bayangan yang menangis di dalam tumpukan buku, hingga mereka melihat sepasang pintu ganda.",
  "Ini bukan pintu yang mereka masuki, tapi pada titik ini itu tidak masalah.",
  "Di atas, terdengar lolongan dari kantor Moore.",
  "Di bawah di lobi, semua Bayangan tiba-tiba menunjuk ke arah mereka, berbisik dengan penuh semangat.",

            original: [
                    "The Lethe.",
  "A great expanse, fathomless and immeasurably wide.",
  "From the shore all one could see was endless darkness stretching toward the dim horizon.",
  "Whatever waited across—King Yama’s throne, the gates back to the living—lay out of sight.",
  "The Lethe was a visual paradox, two things at once.",
  "At first glance, eyes unfocused, the waters were still and silent, a glassy obsidian surface reflecting glimmers of the ever-dying sun.",
  "But then one looked closer, and the Lethe became an agitated churn, all whorls and eddies in currents without direction, and the longer one gazed the louder those waters sounded in one’s ears, bone-deep rumbles from waves roiling beneath the surface.",
  "",
  "Alice stepped closer, entranced.",
  "As a child she had learned that white was all the colors wrapped in one, and she found this profoundly unfair; that one could have seen rainbows everywhere but instead, with weak mortal eyes, saw only plain light.",
  "The Lethe seemed an inverse of this principle.",
  "It was all darkness.",
  "But the moment you fixed your eyes on any one point it began to disambiguate, until you saw that what seemed like sheets of obsidian were in fact waves of color, and those waves of color formed memories.",
  "You could just catch fragments if you squinted.",
  "Here a faded teddy bear; there a pouring stream of red wine; and there a ringed, wrinkled, reaching hand . . . all fragments teasing richer memories, specific details, all the detritus of human experience swirling, condensed into one unending wash.",
  "",
  "Oh, great Lethe.",
  "Hell was always bound by a river.",
  "All the sources confirmed this, regardless of period, geography, or religion.",
  "You didn’t have to call it the Lethe.",
  "You could call it the Apanohuaya, or the Vaitanya.",
  "You could call it the river of Meng Po.",
  "The domain of Neti.",
  "But you could not deny there was the river, delineating boundaries between worlds, severing the cord between this life and whatever came after.",
  "On this side, the courts of punishment.",
  "On the other, Lord Yama’s domain—and the promised golden circle where souls returned to the world of the living.",
  "There were many rivers of power in this world—there were rivers of death, and rivers of love; rivers that could grant immortality, and rivers that could take it away.",
  "Some washed away sin; some merely washed away the guilt.",
  "But only the Lethe washed memory.",
  "",
  "Western Tartarologists preferred the name Lethe for its etymology.",
  "Lethe comes from the Greek lēthē (λήθη), meaning “forgetfulness,” “oblivion.”",
  "Lethe also has connections to the Greek alētheia (ἀλήθεια), meaning “truth.”",
  "Though what connection truth had to forgetfulness, Alice was not sure.",
  "By some accounts, stripping all memories was a way to reveal the most fundamental truth—some ineffable element of the soul that was eternal.",
  "By other accounts, the causation was flipped.",
  "Truth was the necessary condition to deserving forgetfulness, and therefore reincarnation.",
  "Only when one acknowledged the truth about themselves could they wash away the burden of past lives to begin anew.",
  "",
  "Dominant theories linked the memory powers of the Lethe to Heraclitus’s theory of flux.",
  "In most respects Heraclitus was a complete ass, and he was famous for bizarre proclamations like “Everything is its own opposite” and “All things in the universe are manifestations of an ever-living fire.”",
  "Despite this, Heraclitus had made the profound observation that one could never step in the same river twice, because it wouldn’t be the same river, and one wouldn’t be the same person.",
  "The Lethe, then, equated forgetting with rebirth.",
  "The continuity of one’s soul was tied inextricably to the persistence of one’s memories.",
  "When memories were gone, a new soul was born.",
  "The Lethe was forgetting was death was change.",
  "",
  "“Suppose this is another way to go.”",
  "Peter was rifling through his notebook, thinking out loud.",
  "“Around the courts, I mean.",
  "Jesse Hagen had these theories—well, I don’t know if you read Hagen, I did take out the only copy.",
  "But we might move a lot faster if we traveled over water.",
  "The Lethe must pass by every court, so theoretically . . . hm.”",
  "Peter tapped his fingers against his chin.",
  "“But we’ve nothing to build a raft with.”",
  "",
  "Alice had considered the same problem.",
  "Get on a boat.",
  "Sail across; either to successive courts or even to King Yama’s Land across the way.",
  "Yes, Alice had found a footnote citing Hagen’s theory.",
  "But where would they get a boat?",
  "It was hard enough to take one’s mortal soul to Hell.",
  "Pentagrams only stretched so large.",
  "No one had ever managed more than a bit of luggage, much less a vehicle.",
  "And the boat would have to be airtight, waterproof; they could not risk even one drop spilling onto their skin.",
  "On this subject, the literature was very clear.",
  "The waters of the Lethe ate memory.",
  "Even trailing your fingers across the surface could strip you of truths you’d known your whole life.",
  "",
  "Alice had concocted some half-baked ideas about forming a raft with the supplies in her sack.",
  "She might inflate the blanket, perhaps, and try enchanting it so it held the weight of two, and formed a protective barrier besides.",
  "But those waters looked impossible to fool with magick.",
  "Those eddies looked hungry.",
  "They exuded a vicious gravity.",
  "They were negative space, irresistible magnets, black holes of thought.",
  "Try me, the river seemed to say.",
  "I’ll eat your chalk.",
  "",
  "Her arm twitched suddenly.",
  "She tugged her sleeve down.",
  "An old injury.",
  "",
  "Peter was saying something else, but her mind drifted, lost in the river.",
  "She simply could not stop staring at that shifting, swirling surface.",
  "She had the absurd urge to take a swim, and it was the same kind of thought that invaded her mind when she stood any place high up.",
  "What if she climbed out that window?",
  "Tumbled off the edge?",
  "The waters seemed so cool, so soothing, and she imagined herself dropping down through that glassy surface without so much as a ripple.",
  "",
  "A blur marked her vision.",
  "Alice blinked, and when she opened her eyes she saw a woman standing by the shore, old and hunched, terra-cotta jugs arranged neatly on a table beside her.",

  "She’d seen her crop up over centuries of texts.",
  "Old Lady Meng Po, guardian of the river, mother of memory.",
  "Her task was to distill those violent waters into a fragrant herbal liquor.",
  "When souls crossed over it was the lady’s wine they drank; sweet and cooling, eternal relief.",
  "The forgetting of rebirth, not of obliteration.",
  "The lady met Alice’s eyes, and her mouth stretched into a slow, wrinkled smile.",
  "There was no malice in that smile; only a simple, guileless kindness.",
  "Drink, she said; and though no sound carried over the waves Alice understood perfectly what she meant.",
  "Drink, and be at peace, and be gone.",
  "",
  "Oh, how wonderful that would be!",
  "Alice had thought rescuing Professor Grimes from Hell was the solution to her problems—but why go to all that effort?",
  "She almost laughed.",
  "Here was the real answer: to wash away the dregs upon her mind and come out the other side dewy clean; a mewling babe ready to start afresh.",
  "Memories rushed to the fore of her skull, hot and choking foul, and all she could think then was how nice it would be to offload them to the depths; to swirl away and then disseminate forever.",
  "She was so tired of the contents of her mind.",
  "Her thoughts were so loud; they pounded her skull, it never stopped, it was all too much.",
  "For a long time now it had been all too much.",
  "Everyone was so afraid of the Lethe—keep away, they said; stay dry—but why didn’t they understand it was mercy?",
  "All the stories were wrong—no siren’s call was as alluring as the sea itself, and the quiet dark beyond the shore.",

  "Sungai Lethe tampaknya merupakan kebalikan dari prinsip ini.",
  "Itu semua adalah kegelapan.",
  "Tapi saat kamu memusatkan pandangan pada satu titik tertentu, ia mulai menjadi jelas, sampai kamu melihat bahwa yang tampak seperti lembaran obsidian sebenarnya adalah gelombang warna, dan gelombang warna itu membentuk ingatan.",

  "Di sini boneka beruang yang pudar; di sana aliran anggur merah yang tercurah; dan di sana tangan berkerut, berlingkar, yang menggapai . . . semua fragmen menggoda ingatan yang lebih kaya, detail spesifik, semua rongsokan pengalaman manusia yang berputar, terkondensasi menjadi satu cucian yang tak berujung.",

  "Menurut beberapa cerita, menanggalkan semua ingatan adalah cara untuk mengungkap kebenaran paling mendasar—beberapa elemen jiwa yang abadi yang tak terucapkan.",
  "Menurut cerita lain, sebab-akibatnya terbalik.",

  "Teori-teori dominan menghubungkan kekuatan ingatan Lethe dengan teori flux Heraclitus.",

  "Meskipun demikian, Heraclitus telah membuat pengamatan yang mendalam bahwa seseorang tidak pernah bisa menginjak sungai yang sama dua kali, karena itu bukan sungai yang sama, dan orang itu bukan orang yang sama.",

            original: [
                  "To Alice’s great surprise, Archimedes was still with them by morning.",
  "She suspected he only liked them as human shields, but she could not complain.",
  "Cats had many talents, and one of them was finding paths.",
  "Once they’d finished breakfast (Archimedes demanded, and ate, an alarming amount of Lembas Bread mixed in with tea), he marched several steps forward, tail pointing straight up, and glanced back expectantly at them.",
  "",
  "“The second court?” Alice asked.",
  "Archimedes blinked as if to say, Where else?",
  "",
  "“Is it very far off?”",
  "Archimedes turned to show her his bum.",
  "",
  "“Are you excited?” Peter asked as they packed up camp.",
  "“What on earth for?”",
  "“Why, the Court of Desire.” He waggled his fingers.",
  "“Filthy lust.",
  "Don’t you want to meet Jezebel?",
  "Bathsheba?”",
  "She snorted.",
  "“You think Desire is all brothels?”",
  "“I think it’s a treat compared to the dunes, at least.” He zipped up his rucksack and stood.",
  "“What do you think’s waiting for you?”",
  "Alice slung on her own rucksack, caught a whiff of her armpits, and winced.",
  "“I’d be happy with a hot shower.”",
  "",
  "Desire posed an interesting puzzle for Tartarologists, who widely believed that this second court was strangely more lenient than the rest.",
  "It was Dante who posited that lust, the sin of “carnal malefactors,” was a lesser sin; a sin of incontinence, weakness of the will, rather than active malice toward others.",
  "Those guilty of lust had made reason slave to appetite.",
  "Dante’s circle was full of lovers; mutually indulgent sops whose succumbing to their passions hurt no one but themselves.",
  "For this reason, many Tartarologists argued that the punishment of Desire, which by most accounts encompassed both lust and gluttony, was the source of addiction itself—both motivation of appetite and cause of harm.",
  "It trapped you with enticements; it made you the cause of your own suffering.",
  "Every other court kept you trapped with locked doors and difficult challenges and vengeful deities, but Desire trapped you all on its own.",
  "",
  "The sojourner’s accounts supported this theory.",
  "The Christian explorer John Bancroft described Desire as a false imitation of paradise wherein punishment lay in temptation.",
  "You succumbed, you indulged, and you were never able to leave.",
  "For three days I pillowed against breasts and thighs, smoking and drinking among the Lotus Eaters, he wrote.",
  "Only through sheer force of will did I leave their sweet company.",
  "O they cried for me, those poor women, and I as well at our parting.",
  "But they understood I was sworn to my divine mission, and were persuaded to let me go.",
  "And then he went on about the breasts and thighs upon which he had pillowed for another several pages.",
  "",
  "“He won’t be in there,” said Alice.",
  "Professor Grimes had many flaws.",
  "Overindulgence in appetite was not one of them; she had never met a more disciplined man.",
  "“We’ll be wasting our time.”",
  "“Well, we’ve still got to check.”",
  "“But suppose we get trapped.”",
  "“We won’t,” Peter said cheerfully, trudging off after the impatient Archimedes.",
  "“We have extreme moral fortitude.”",
  "",
  "All the scholars Alice knew at Cambridge were so proud of rejecting their desires.",
  "It was the other departments that had sex addicts, drug addicts, alcoholics, foodies.",
  "But in the Department of Analytic Magick, gross sensual pleasures were looked down upon as a distraction from the life of the mind.",
  "Everyone liked to pretend they did not exist outside of their research, that their earthly bodies had no wants at all.",
  "No one admitted to watching television.",
  "No one kept up with pop culture.",
  "No one admitted to their professors that they were going on dates (to admit to being a sexual creature at all was so humiliating!).",
  "Those few who were married mentioned their wives and children with great embarrassment, and only to assure skeptics that the wives were managing the children.",
  "No one even admitted to liking the taste of food, which perhaps explained why the department only ever catered Yorkshire puddings that tasted of sand.",
  "",
  "The only acceptable hobbies were those that honed the mind and body for sustained study in some way.",
  "Chess was mandatory.",
  "A light rambling was tolerable.",
  "Marathons were especially lauded because they demonstrated the discipline and focus of one’s mind.",
  "It was rumored that Professor Helen Murray could run for hours at a time listening to nothing but operas she replayed in her head.",
  "Yes, leisure for self-improvement was allowed.",
  "But pleasure for pleasure’s sake—how useless, how embarrassing.",
  "",
  "Professor Grimes was the most fanatic about his asceticism.",
  "“To learn is the most godlike thing we can do,” he told them.",
  "He had given them this lecture in their first years, back when they were foolish enough to think they could make time for things like sleeping or seeing movies.",
  "“Humans, unlike animals, are born with the faculty of reason.",
  "This places us above beasts, and near to God.",
  "And so as Aristotle says, we ought to be pro-immortal, and go to all lengths to live a life in accord with our supreme element.",
  "The life of the mind is all there is.",
  "Anything else is degeneracy, is bodily, is filth.”",
  "",
  "Alice had tried, really tried, to obey his command.",
  "To whittle herself down to just the burning core of a mind.",
  "She stopped going to the cinema.",
  "She stopped reading novels—goodbye, Henry James!",
  "She even stopped cooking for herself, since the campus butteries both cost less and took all pleasure out of eating.",
  "She could not reach the freakish discipline of Aleco, the postdoc who ran two miles every morning to the department; or of Chloe, the junior hire, who bragged she ate only one meal a day at five in the morning, and otherwise meditated if she felt dizzy.",
  "Alice did manage to imitate Harris the fifth-year’s habit of taking icy-cold showers every morning, in hopes that it energized one for the day, though she could not tell if her rush of excitement after the shower was merely due to her relief upon stepping out.",
  "There was the question of whether all this was character-building asceticism or simply the demands of poverty, since none of the graduate students made close to a living wage.",
  "But nobody liked to talk about that.",
  "",
  "There was a period when she did succeed in curing herself of most mundane needs.",
  "Some days she would eat only a piece of Lembas bread with coffee for breakfast, and then become so absorbed in her studies that she did not think to eat again until midnight.",
  "Sometimes she managed to put off even the Lembas Bread until well after noon.",
  "She liked the light, absent feeling she got when her stomach was completely empty and she was running only on air.",
  "When she felt a pale and ethereal shade, a mind that existed without a body.",
  "",
  "But the crash always came.",
  "Alice always broke; always ended up lying in a stupor on the couch watching without processing whatever came on the television in the cottage lounge.",
  "Never could she quite achieve that blissful intellectual Zen; that runner’s high of peaceful contemplation.",
  "More often she felt bereft; unsatisfied and unsatisfying, trapped in a body that needed.",
  "And hungry, so hungry, for a kind of nourishment she could no longer name.",
  "",
  "It turned out Hell had inclement weather.",
  "The storm came on all at once.",
  "The sky darkened, the air chilled and thickened.",
  "There was a crack of thunder, and then the sky poured down thick sheets of rain.",
  "This was bad news for Alice and Peter, who had not thought to pack raincoats.",
  "",
  "“No way around?” Peter shouted to Archimedes over the winds.",
  "The cat mewed.",
  "",
  "The storm intensified quickly.",
  "In minutes they were soaked.",
  "The squalls of wind and rain whipped so fiercely around them they had to clamp their hands around their faces just to breathe.",
  "Archimedes stopped and refused to go on until Peter scooped him up in his arms and tucked him into his coat.",
  "A miserable little huddle, they inched forth.",
  "Somewhere in the howling winds Alice thought she heard a weeping, a human voice, or many of them, but that could easily have been the winds themselves, which had risen to a deafening shriek.",
  "She could not tell how long they went on like this.",
  "She lost all sense of time.",
  "The storm stripped her of any thought, any sense.",
  "She was just a core, quivering against the squall, inching along.",
  "",
  "Yet this, too, was familiar.",
  "Alice had survived several English winters now, winters of faulty radiators and broken umbrellas and surprise storms cracking above you just when you thought the skies had no more to give.",
  "She had run all over Cambridge in those storms, and she knew that sometimes the struggle was not over indefinitely stretched space, but the simple agony of getting from one building to the next when the rain bashed like a hammer.",
  "So she knew to shrink into herself and press along, inch by inch, until at last they passed under Desire’s roof, between the bronze statues that guarded its entry.",
  "Not lions, Alice saw.",
  "Pigs.",
  "The doors swung open.",
  "Dripping and shivering, they tumbled inside.",
  "",
  "Desire was a student center.",
  "This greatly disappointed Alice, who despite herself had hoped for something out of those terrible Orientalist paintings—gilded sofas, hanging grapes, roast boars with apples in their mouths, and lute players in loincloths.",
  "Or even a deranged sight out of a Bosch painting—naked revelers, flowers growing out of buttholes, bodies copulating in giant mussel shells.",
  "Giant strawberries, crowns of cherries.",
  "Most of all she wanted to see some food.",
  "Of course it would be imprudent to eat anything—one was never to touch the food of Hell—but after those endless dunes even a facsimile of a feast would have been welcome.",
  "",
  "Instead the lobby was all too-bright lights, high-top tables, and randomly arranged couches with suspicious yellow stains.",
  "At the center stood a fountain, from which burbled something thick and purplish brown.",
  "From the ceiling, a musical number played over a faint, staticky crackle—some almost recognizable Dusty Springfield number, something you might close your eyes to and sway to before last call at the pub, a bit too soft to make out clearly either the melody or the lyrics.",
  "In the far corner sat a foosball table, abandoned, though when Alice glanced over the top she saw the little white ball still pinging about, knocking against wooden feet with a will of its own.",
  "Her hand twitched instinctively to try it, to see if she could knock that ball into the goal.",
  "",
  "“Oh, hello,” said Peter.",
  "A Shade came shuffling from the corner, bearing a golden goblet in its hands.",
  "It seemed to move straight for them.",
  "Alice tensed then, suddenly frightened.",
  "But it was headed for the fountain.",
  "",
  "“Excuse me,” said Alice.",
  "“Hello there,” said Peter.",
  "“I wonder if—er, if you’ve seen anyone new pass by?",
  "Tall man in black?”",
  "",
  "The Shade ignored them both.",
  "In silence it filled a goblet from the stream, took a long draft of that thick dark liquid, then shuffled on back to the hallway where it had come.",
  "It entered the first room on the right, and the door swung shut behind it.",
  "",
  "Alice and Peter followed tentatively.",
  "Around the corner loomed an endless hallway resembling a student dormitory, rooms lining either side, uniform and windowless.",
  "Some of the doors were shut.",
  "Many were not.",
  "They hung ajar, and Alice and Peter peeked inside them one by one as they strode through.",
  "A single Shade occupied each room.",
  "One lay flat on its back, hands wedged inside its pants.",
  "Another smoked a pipe in a room wafting over with tobacco so pungent it sent Alice into a coughing fit as they hurried past.",
  "A third sat cross-legged on the floor, eyes closed, sipping slowly from that same kind of golden goblet they’d just seen.",
  "No one glanced up when Alice and Peter peeked in.",
  "No one seemed aware of their surroundings at all.",
  "",
  "A few doors down, they heard a loud snuffling noise.",
  "A Shade sat hunched over a table in the corner.",
  "He held books up close to his nose, and every time he turned the page he sniffed up and down the spine, eyes rolling to the back of his head with pleasure.",
  "",
  "“Carry on.” Peter gripped Alice’s wrist and tugged her along the hall.",
  "“What was that?” she hissed.",
  "“What was he doing?”",
  "“You’ve never sniffed a book before?”",
  "“Not like that!”",
  "“Well, it’s very nice,” said Peter.",
  "“Something about the binding.",
  "It’s like—glue, I don’t know.",
  "Wood shavings.",
  "I get it.”",
  "Alice muttered, “I would simply have kept that to myself.”",
  "",
  "Down the hall was more of the same: Shades upon Shades sitting freely in their cells, repeating singular, rote activities.",
  "Alice looked at every face as they wandered by, scanning for Professor Grimes’s scowl, but all she saw were blank, vaguely satisfied stares.",
  "It became hard to look at, after a while.",
  "All those uniform expressions of complacency.",
  "Some of the Shades seemed to be losing their outlines, their faces smudged and blurry at the edges.",
  "Some Shades seemed not to have eyes.",
  "Others had no definition to their mouths, ears, or hands—all senses extraneous to the drive, satisfaction at hand.",
  "They were caught in an endless compulsive loop with themselves, repeating a motion that apparently never gave full satisfaction, or was otherwise so delightful that they just kept doing it, again and again.",
  "",
  "The whole place was suffused with an aura of decay.",
  "The hallway smelled of something foul and antiseptic both at once, like rubbing alcohol sprayed on rot, and the lights were too dim, crackling with fluorescent hum.",
  "Cracks and patches of mold littered the walls, lines of ants ran along the stains, and it was all so foul that Alice was agonized that these Shades could not simply stop, take a look around, and flee the place.",
  "Stop it, she wanted to shriek, put it down, get out—but half these Shades did not even have ears.",
  "If she screamed to them, would they hear?",
  "",
  "She and Peter had both long lapsed into silence.",
  "It grew progressively more uncomfortable, looking voyeuristically into these addictions, trying to pretend they were completely unstimulated by anything they saw.",
  "Alice felt exposed and naked.",
  "She felt she was being tested, monitored to see if any of these enticements aroused similar interests in herself.",
  "Do you like feet?",
  "Do you like dolls?",
  "Do you like hard wooden objects?",
  "",
  "What did Peter desire?",
  "Alice wondered.",
  "Probably nothing.",
  "Peter came into this world with a silver spoon in his mouth; Peter had never wanted for anything.",
  "But that was the wrong sense of want.",
  "Desire and need were very different, and she wished she knew what Peter craved, what made him weak in the knees, because then at least she would know that Peter had any vulnerabilities at all.",
  "Here, though, Peter’s expression never changed.",
  "He kept such a straight face; he only peered around with clinical, faintly condescending curiosity.",
  "Saint Peter could not be tempted.",
  "",
  "The objects of lust kept growing to ridiculous proportions.",
  "They saw Shades fellating dogs, licking chalkboards, writhing upon beds of panties; Shades pouring wine in a stupor, Shades shuddering over furls of smoke.",
  "One Shade paced back and forth murmuring Thank you, thank you as staticky machines played tapes of canned applause.",
  "It wasn’t remotely funny anymore—far from the sensational temptations of Bosch’s paintings, the sights in these cells were only sad and sickening.",
  "So much of the body was on display—breathy moans and slapping and licking and squelching; bodies pierced by needles, bodies choking on food, on wine; just bodies all around, not even full bodies really but reaching organs; working mouths and darting eyes and grasping hands, abandoned by reason, lost to appetite.",
  "",
  "Why couldn’t they just walk away?",
  "Alice couldn’t understand it.",
  "She had never been able to understand this gross, physical desire.",
  "She was familiar with the basic pleasures, yes, but she had never felt such bodily longing that it overwhelmed her mind.",
  "It baffled her that in all the stories, heroes were constantly letting cities collapse so they could rub their bits on someone else.",
  "David lost his kingdom for Bathsheba, the Greeks gave it all up over Helen, and the great Dr. Faust, when he had Mephistopheles at his disposal, only wanted to use his newfound powers to seduce Gretchen.",
  "Sex was not a noble desire, it was such an embarrassing capitulation.",
  "There was a kind of genuine longing, Alice knew, but in her view it had so little to do with clumsy machinations of the body, with mashing teeth and sandpaper stubble, rough hands and foul breath.",
  "To her they seemed worlds apart, but she had never figured out how to sublimate it, this confused, burning want; this full-body desire she felt most acutely when she looked at—",
  "",
  "“Gosh,” said Peter.",
  "“It just keeps going on.”",
  "",
  "It was getting harder to keep walking, to keep peeking in; and harder to breathe; and the fluorescent hum and mold and damp were so much that finally Alice could not take it anymore.",
  "“He’s not in here.” She halted.",
  "“Let’s go back out, let’s walk around.”",
  "“I thought you wanted to check every court,” said Peter.",
  "“Well, we’ve checked.”",
  "“We’ve only been here an hour—”",
  "“That’s enough to know.",
  "He’s not in here.”",
  "“You said that about Pride, too.”",
  "“Well, it’s true.” Alice sniffed.",
  "“He’s not here—he’s better than this—”",
  "“How do you know that?”",
  "“Because it’s all so pathetic!” Her head felt oddly light.",
  "She couldn’t understand why her chest was constricting, why it felt so hard to breathe.",
  "“It’s base, disgusting—he won’t be here, whatever he’s done, it’s above that—”",
  "“I don’t think so.” Peter’s voice was oddly cold then.",
  "“I think there’s every chance he’s here.”",
  "“That’s ridiculous.”",
  "“You think so highly of him.”",
  "“It’s not a compliment.” Alice folded her arms.",
  "“Lust is a sin of incontinence.",
  "It’s a weakness of will—I mean, just look around us—and whatever Grimes was, he was not weak of will.”",
  "“Jesus.” There again, that cold tone.",
  "It baffled her; she had never seen him like this, and she couldn’t understand why he was so angry.",
  "“Sing his praises some more, why don’t you?”",
  "“I’m just scared of wasting time,” she said.",
  "“That’s all I’m saying.",
  "We’ve seen enough, this isn’t like him, and I’m tired of walking through this stupid—”",
  "",
  "Peter threw up a hand.",
  "Shut up, it said, the universal gesture—and Alice was about to voice her indignation when Peter pointed to a door down the hall.",
  "Faint, muffled noises came from within—shouting?",
  "Screaming?",
  "Peter cocked his head, eyebrows raised in a bizarrely suggestive manner.",
  "He lifted a finger to his lips and crept closer, motioning for Alice to follow.",
  "",
  "“Don’t.” Alice felt an instinctive dread.",
  "“Please, Peter, don’t—”",
  "“But there’s something,” he exclaimed.",
  "“There’s someone.”",
  "",
  "The muffled voices grew louder.",
  "Peter ran up to the door and threw it open.",
  "",
  "Behind the door was an office.",
  "And in the office two shades were locked in torrid embrace, their faces blurred and unclear—all facets to their existence unclear and forgotten, in fact, except for bright, red genitals.",
  "Neither took notice of Alice or Peter.",
  "One had the other bent over the desk in what looked like a terribly uncomfortable position, but both were going at it with frantic desperation, howling so loud that the sound shook the walls: “Oh!",
  "Oh!",
  "Oh!”",
  "",
  "Was all sex so vulgar?",
  "Alice stood frozen, staring as the rhythmic exchange seared into her memory—the sloppy, wet squelching, the pulsing and throbbing of organs enlarged, exaggerated, the only defined feature of Shades who remembered nothing else—and then was superimposed on every other memory she’d ever had, every touch, every moment she had ever come close to another wanting body.",
  "All need, compulsion, satisfaction; and it was just bodies in the end, mounds of female flesh served up like pork, Marilyn Monroe’s splayed fingers, Jessica Rabbit, breasts bouncing.",
  "Jezebel dressed to the nines, leaning out a window, and dogs gnawing at her flesh.",
  "DJs laughed and the headlines whizzed.",
  "Fucking bunnies, fucking like bunnies, a jackhammer, a sledgehammer, iron into flesh, the needle the chalk and the ink, in and out and in and out, and it all culminated in a grip, a squeeze, a sigh.",
  "Alice tried her catechism, tried to reel it all back, but it did not work, the visions kept spiraling out, it was happening again.",
  "She felt so far away.",
  "Her body was not hers and she was drifting back, spilling out.",
  "She grasped for the staircase, but it was not there—",
  "",
  "Peter stepped back so quickly he stumbled against Alice.",
  "“Wasn’t him.” He let out a hysterical giggle.",
  "“I guess—I thought—”",
  "",
  "She reeled back.",
  "“Are you all right?” He reached out to touch her arm, but she smacked him away.",
  "Just then she couldn’t stand his presence, any presence.",
  "If anyone came near her she would scream.",
  "",
  "He reached out again.",
  "“You’re breathing all funny.”",
  "",
  "She dashed past him back down the corridor.",
  "A terrible wrenching roiled her gut.",
  "He followed her down the hall.",
  "She pressed both hands against the first door to the outside she could find and pushed, spilling back out into the storm.",
  "Then the world tilted, and the ground came near, and Peter caught her just as she keeled over and vomited.",
  "",
  "“WHAT DO YOU DESIRE MOST?” Professor Grimes had once asked her.",
  "",
  "They were sitting at a seaside café in Venice, drunk on victory and Aperol spritzes and baking in the afternoon sun.",
  "It was their first afternoon in the city; they’d just arrived from a weeklong hiking expedition through the chalk deposits of the Vena del Gesso with representatives from the Italian Academy of Magick, and now they were tanned and pleasantly exhausted.",
  "Professor Grimes was lapsing into riddles and sophistry, and Alice, buzzed, responded lightly in kind, saying just enough to keep Professor Grimes talking.",
  "She loved when he just rambled, effortlessly profound, without an ounce of self-consciousness.",
  "She loved seeing how he processed the world; hearing his messiest, unformed thoughts.",
  "It gave her clues for how to imitate him, to model her life and career after his.",
  "She knew she was silly, thinking she could take up space in the world like he did when they presented so differently.",
  "But could she not at least remind people who her mentor was?",
  "Academic lineage mattered so much in the right circles.",
  "And back then all she wanted, with every fiber of her being, was for people to remember she was his echo.",
  "",
  "“Nothing,” said Alice, trying to be droll.",
  "“I live the life of an aesthete.”",
  "“Very funny.",
  "But what do you want, Law?”",
  "“Success.” She fiddled with her glass.",
  "“I want a job, and a lab of my own, and several books to my name.",
  "I want your office and my name on the door,” she added, hoping to make him laugh.",
  "",
  "But his face was dead serious.",
  "“Those are by-products of desire.",
  "What do you want?”",
  "“That is what I want.”",
  "“No, it’s not.” He reached out and seized her wrist; squeezed it with surprising force.",
  "She winced but did not cry out.",
  "She was shocked more than hurt; frozen in place like a deer in headlights, all senses trained on whatever he did next.",
  "With Professor Grimes, she never knew.",

  "“You’ve got to think about what keeps you up at night,” he said.",
  "“What burns inside you?",
  "What fuels your every action?",

  "Oh!”",

  "Apakah semua seks sevulgar itu?",
"Alice berdiri membeku, menatap saat pertukaran ritmis itu membekas dalam ingatannya—suara kecipak yang basah dan ceroboh, denyutan dan detak organ yang membesar, dilebih-lebihkan, satu-satunya fitur yang jelas dari Arwah yang tidak mengingat apa-apa lagi—dan kemudian ditumpangkan pada setiap ingatan lain yang pernah dimilikinya, setiap sentuhan, setiap saat dia pernah dekat dengan tubuh lain yang menginginkan.",
"Semua kebutuhan, paksaan, kepuasan; dan pada akhirnya itu hanyalah tubuh, gundukan daging wanita disajikan seperti daging babi, jari-jari Marilyn Monroe yang terentang, Jessica Rabbit, payudara yang memantul.",
  "Izebel berdandan necis, menjulur ke luar jendela, dan anjing-anjing menggerogoti dagingnya.",
  "Para DJ tertawa dan berita utama melesat.",
  "Kelinci sialan, bercinta seperti kelinci, bor pneumatik, palu godam, besi ke daging, jarum, kapur dan tinta, masuk dan keluar dan masuk dan keluar, dan semuanya memuncak dalam cengkeraman, remasan, desahan.",
  "Alice mencoba katekismusnya, mencoba menarik semuanya kembali, tetapi tidak berhasil, bayangan-bayangan itu terus berputar di luar kendali, itu terjadi lagi.",

  "Profesor Grimes mulai mengucapkan teka-teki dan sofisme, dan Alice, yang sedikit mabuk, menanggapinya dengan ringan, mengatakan secukupnya agar Profesor Grimes terus berbicara.",
  "Dia senang ketika beliau hanya mengoceh, terdengar sangat mendalam, tanpa sedikit pun rasa canggung.",
  "Dia senang melihat bagaimana beliau memproses dunia; mendengar pikirannya yang paling berantakan dan belum terbentuk.",

  "Itu memberinya petunjuk bagaimana menirunya, bagaimana mencontoh kehidupan dan kariernya seperti beliau.",
  "Dia tahu dia konyol, berpikir dia bisa mengambil ruang di dunia seperti beliau padahal penampilan mereka sangat berbeda.",
  "Tetapi tidak bisakah dia setidaknya mengingatkan orang siapa mentornya?",
  "Garis keturunan akademik sangat berarti di lingkaran yang tepat.",

 "“Ya,” dia ingin berkata.",
  "“Itu dia, begitulah yang kurasakan.”",
  "Tapi itu tidak benar, dan dia tidak bisa mengartikulasikannya seperti itu.",
 "Dia tidak bisa menemukan satu pun pertanyaan penelitian yang memotivasinya sebesar yang beliau harapkan.",
  "Pada saat itu dia tidak bisa mengingat mengapa penelitiannya, proyek-proyek kecil yang membosankan tentang teka-teki linguistik, penting sama sekali.",
  "Dan bahkan jika dia tidak mabuk *prosecco*, dia tidak akan pernah memiliki kosakata untuk memilah gejolak kompleks antara ketakutan dan hasrat yang membuatnya bangun sebelum fajar dan membuatnya tetap di lab hingga larut malam.",

  "Alice telah menonton dari barisan depan, gemetar karena bangga saat beliau memukau penonton paling cerdas di dunia, saat kata-kata keluar dari mulutnya dalam paragraf-paragraf yang begitu sempurna dan artikulatif, ide-ide menggantung di udara seperti suar yang bersinar.",
 "Tidak masalah bahwa dia telah mendengar semuanya sebelumnya, bahwa sebenarnya dialah yang mengetiknya, mengaturnya menjadi struktur yang masuk akal.",
  "Sepertinya dia baru pertama kali mempelajarinya, memahami signifikansinya.",

  "Dia bukan anak kecil lagi; dia telah meninggalkan patologi ini di universitas.",
"Tetapi itu bukan hanya pencarian jawaban, atau kepuasan sederhana dari teka-teki yang terpecahkan.",
 "Itu adalah sensasi primitif, kesadaran yang memabukkan tentang akan menjadi apa dia nantinya, dunia apa yang bisa dia buka, dan itu semua terkait erat dengan beliau.",

"Yang dia miliki hanyalah pisau berburunya.",
  "",
  "“Apa kau tahu cara menggunakannya?” tanya Peter.",
  "“Tidak.” Alice memberinya pisau yang lebih panjang, gagangnya terlebih dahulu.",
 "Dia membelinya di saat-saat terakhir di toko amal; dia baru sekali menghunusnya.",
  "“Kau mau mencobanya?”",
  "Dia menimangnya di tangannya, mengerutkan kening, dan memegang bilahnya dengan canggung di depannya dengan cara yang tidak meyakinkan.",
  "",
  "Makhluk-makhluk tulang itu berhenti dalam satu barisan.",
  "Mereka tampaknya jauh lebih tidak takut pada Lethe daripada pendahulu mereka, karena mereka telah maju sampai ke tepi pantai, mengapit Alice dan Peter di antara mereka dan perairan.",
  "Kali ini jenisnya lebih beragam—beberapa sekecil anak kucing, beberapa seukuran serigala, dan tengkorak mereka dirangkai dari berbagai jenis hewan.",
  "Beberapa memiringkan kepala mereka dengan cara yang mungkin terlihat lucu; andai saja ada sesuatu selain kekosongan di rongga mata mereka, andai saja anggota tubuh mereka tidak disempurnakan secara ajaib dengan cakar dan taring dari spesies lain yang dijahit di setiap sendi.",

  "“Kita mungkin masih—dia mungkin ingin bicara.”",

  "Sendi leher mereka terus berbunyi klik saat pandangan mereka menjelajahi Peter dan Alice, seolah memproses setiap detail tentang mereka.",
  "Alice bertanya-tanya di mana pencipta mereka sekarang.",
  "Apakah dia sedang menunggu di kejauhan untuk menghabisi mereka, atau mengendalikan makhluk-makhluk ini melalui koneksi magis, melihat melalui rongga mata mereka yang kosong.",

  "“Apa—apa kalian mengerti apa yang kami katakan?”",
  "Makhluk-makhluk tulang itu tidak menunjukkan tanda-tanda bahwa mereka mengerti.",

  "Alice mengayunkan pisaunya, tetapi sulit untuk mengenai sasaran dengan bilahnya ketika makhluk-makhluk itu datang dari berbagai sudut.",
  "Dengan membabi buta dia mengayunkan pisaunya, dan sepertinya bagus bahwa logam beradu dengan tulang—dia pikir mungkin dia berhasil menangkis mereka.",
  "Tetapi jumlah mereka begitu banyak, dia tidak tahu harus melihat ke mana, hanya bisa mencoba menjauhkan mereka dari leher, wajah, dan dadanya.",
  "Sesuatu mendarat di bahunya.",
  "Rasa sakit meledak, panas membara, membutakan.",

  "Rasanya seperti bunuh diri membelakangi mereka, tetapi alih-alih bertahan, dia berlari ke air.",
  "Dia berusaha untuk tidak melangkah terlalu jauh, tetapi ombak Lethe bergelora tak terduga.",
"Air sedingin es menyentuh pergelangan kakinya.",

  "Rasa sakit yang lebih tajam di lengan atasnya.",
  "Ingatan-ingatan melarikan diri?",
  "Dia tidak tahu apa yang telah hilang darinya, dia juga tidak punya waktu untuk menyelidikinya.",

  "“Tidak suka itu, ya?”",
  "Kawanan yang tersisa berkumpul dalam gerombolan.",
  "Air Lethe ternyata efektif di luar dugaan terliarnya.",

  "Semudah itukah?",
  "",
  "“Mundur.” Dia mengacungkan labu itu.",
  "“Kembali ke tempat asal kalian.”",
"Tiba-tiba kawanan itu bersatu dan menerjang Alice.",

  "Dia hanya punya waktu untuk mengangkat tangannya menutupi wajah.",
  "Mereka mendarat di mana-mana; gigi-gigi menancap di pakaiannya, bahunya, sisinya, kakinya.",
 "Peter meneriakkan namanya.",
  "Di antara tumpukan tulang, dia melihat sekilas Peter di pantai, tangannya terulur ke arahnya, tetapi sudah terlambat.",
  "Sesuatu yang tajam menggigit pinggulnya.",
  "Dia tersentak berputar, dan pergelangan kakinya terkilir.",
  "Keseimbangannya goyah, dan dia beserta seluruh gerombolan yang terhuyung-huyung itu terlempar ke belakang, tercebur ke dalam air."

  "Mereka tidak bisa mengatakan apakah pertempuran itu sepadan, atau bahkan untuk apa semuanya.",

  "Sihir tidak disukai, dia suka memberitahu mereka, salah satu tanda peradaban yang dekaden.",
  "Dia sering mengeluhkan ini sehingga mereka hafal di luar kepala.",
  "Manusia dulu adalah raksasa, dan dengan setiap generasi berikutnya penurunannya tumbuh.",
  "Aristoteles menciptakan logika, Euclid geometri, Kant alasan sistematis.",
  "Keuntungan pemikiran setelahnya marjinal.",
  "Tidak ada yang menciptakan sistem utuh lagi; mereka hanya bisa mengutak-atik apa yang datang sebelumnya, jika mereka bahkan bisa memahami orang-orang kuno dengan cukup baik untuk mengutak-atik.",
  "Generasi mereka adalah yang paling dekaden dan bodoh dari semua.",
  "Generasi Grimes setidaknya adalah penyihir perang; mereka telah mendorong bidang ini melompat-lompat dalam aplikasi praktisnya.",

  "Mereka membuat gadget mencolok untuk perusahaan mainan.",
  "Yang terbaik di antara mereka mencari residensi di Vegas; yang terburuk di antara mereka menjadi konsultan.",
  "Tidak diragukan lagi, sihir sedang menurun.",
  "Dan ini hanyalah gejala dunia di mana anak-anak tidak membaca tetapi duduk mengiler di depan layar; di mana seniman mencipratkan cat secara acak dan menganggap diri mereka setara dengan Michelangelo.",
  "Mereka bukanlah dunia orang terpelajar; tidak memiliki perhatian untuk penyelidikan berkelanjutan; orang-orang zaman mereka hanya menginginkan tabloid, gosip, hiburan.",
  "Runtuhnya peradaban, kiamat yang akan datang—mereka melupakan kebesaran nenek moyang mereka, mereka terjebak dalam debat kecil yang tidak berguna; mereka tidak bisa keluar, tidak ada yang tahu bagaimana berpikir lagi.",
  "Pada titik ini dalam omelan dia selalu mabuk anggur, dan lebih kuat karenanya; dan mereka terpana, bersalah seperti yang dituduhkan, putus asa untuk membuktikannya salah.",
  "Bagaimana mereka bisa menjadi raksasa?",
  "Itu butuh kejeniusan, katanya pada mereka; usaha yang luar biasa; dedikasi monastik untuk bangkit di atas puing-puing dunia mereka yang kacau dan melihat dengan jelas di atas awan.",
  "Bisakah mereka melakukannya?",

  "Peter memiliki bakat untuk membuatmu merasa seperti ini, seperti dia adalah satu-satunya di dunia yang mengerti kamu, dan kamu dia.",
  "Seperti kalian berdua ada di bidang kalian sendiri.",
  "Lalu keesokan paginya dia akan bertingkah seperti orang asing yang lengkap.",
  "Seolah-olah kamu belum pernah berbicara sama sekali.",

  "Dia tahu lebih baik sekarang.",

  "",
  "Panas membara naik ke pipinya.",
  "Itu pasti efek Neraka, bukit pasir dan terornya yang tak ada habisnya dan semua kekurangan yang menyertainya, dan fakta bahwa Peter Murdoch adalah satu-satunya makhluk di seluruh alam yang tidak tidak substansial seperti napas.",
  "Namun dia tidak bisa menyingkirkan khayalan untuk bersandar dan meletakkan telapak tangannya di pipinya.",

  "Mencengangkan bahwa manusia telah berevolusi selama ribuan tahun, hanya untuk berakhir seperti Peter Murdoch.",

  "Sebundel catatan mengintip dari tasnya.",

  "Penasaran, dia menariknya keluar.",
  "Dia selalu menikmati membaca karya Peter; itu menyenangkan untuk melihat di mana pikirannya cocok dengan atau menyimpang dari miliknya.",
  "",
  "Dua halaman pertama adalah sketsa pentagram—empat cara gagal untuk sampai ke Neraka, dan satu yang berhasil.",
  "Dia mengenal teorema-teorema itu; dia sendiri menghabiskan minggu-minggu memikirkan mereka.",
  "Dia merasakan sensasi yang familiar saat menelusuri karyanya, saat dia melihat pada tahap apa dan bagaimana dia memecahkan teka-teki yang sama yang dia miliki.",
  "Proses Peter, tentu saja, brilian.",
  "Beberapa solusinya jauh lebih elegan daripada miliknya, dan pada satu tahap dia melewati formula yang rumit yang dia perjuangkan dengan tampaknya mengintuisikan solusinya.",
  "Pada akhirnya, dia memutuskan metode yang sama yang dia miliki—Ramanujan’s Summation, dengan Setiya’s Modifications.",
  "Tidak heran dia langsung menyadari apa yang dia lakukan.",
  "Semua pekerjaan mereka sama.",

  "It cannot be true that Alice and Peter are friends and not friends.",

  "The Law of the Excluded Middle holds that either a proposition is true, or it is false.",
  "There is no hazy middle ground.",
  "As Aristotle put it, sentences can be ambiguous in their meaning but not in their truth.",
  "So either the statement that Alice and Peter are friends is true, or it is false.",
  "This statement cannot be some mysterious third thing.",
  "",
  "Many problems threaten to break classical logic.",
  "The Sorites Paradox and the Liar Paradox, for instance, are difficult puzzles that force classical logic to reexamine what it means by truth.",
  "classical logic also has yet to come up with an answer to Russell’s Paradox, which is too complicated to explain here but has to do with a contradiction of set theory.",
  "And classical logic especially falls apart as a language applied to human relationships, which are messy and complicated and often situated in that excluded middle; that space where no one is right and no one is wrong and things are neither true nor false.",
  "The upshot here is that classical logic does not know what to do with the statement:",

  "Alice would always remember the moment she first laid eyes on Peter Murdoch.",
  "Michaelmas Term, two years prior.",
  "Cambridge was gorgeous in golden autumn sun.",
  "The wind was pleasantly cool, the leaves reddening ever so slightly in a way that had always excited Alice, for the end of summer meant the start of a new semester; new classes, new instructors, and new classmates.",
  "A chance to reinvent herself, and become the person she wanted to be.",
  "",
  "Six students had been admitted to their cohort but that afternoon only five were present at the tea in the courtyard behind the department, clutching cups and saucers close to their chests as they cautiously made introductions.",
  "There was Belinda Wilcox, an English rose whose red-gold hair and pert nose made Alice hopelessly jealous; a Frenchman and an Italian whose names she could not make out over the clamor of voices; and Calvin Bailey, a fellow American transplant from Michigan, who shared Alice’s ineptitude with all the little spoons, saucers, and tongs that went into constructing a cup of tea.",
  "",
  "The small talk was polite and meaningless.",
  "Alice was too focused on keeping her hands from shaking to say much.",
  "She felt badly out of place—American colleges were grand, but they didn’t have history, didn’t have tradition, and her advisor at Cornell had actually invited her to a sit-down dinner in which he taught her how to use cutlery before she flew out to London—and the easy shine and polish of her new cohort-mates made her feel doubly inadequate.",
  "Even the Europeans seemed more fluent in British English than she was; she could barely keep up with what they were saying.",
  "She didn’t know what a tripos was; she was still saying “math” in the singular; she didn’t understand what anyone meant by Mill or Peterhouse.",
  "That morning she’d put on her best summer dress, a frilly yellow thing with a lace collar that normally made her feel sharp, but now, among her sleek, darkly dressed colleagues, she felt like a cheap and gaudy daffodil.",
  "",
  "She tried to squash her anxieties and focus on Belinda, though up close Belinda was so dazzling it was hard to get any words out.",
  "The sun kept catching her eyelashes in a manner that was truly unfair, for how could lashes be so dark and shimmering both at once?",
  "Belinda was telling some story about a Chinese undergraduate she’d mentored over the summer—“Her English was fine, and she was very sweet and polite and all that, but my God, she never talked.",
  "It was only ever Yes, Belinda, or I’m great, Belinda in these little simpering tones—and I was getting really angry at her for it, that is, the fact that she was so uninteresting, because being boring is a trait I find unforgivable.",
  "And then halfway through the summer she revealed that her father is one of the richest men in Taiwan, one of those real estate millionaires, and he didn’t approve of women in the sciences, and she’d told him she’d come to an art history program and was learning magick on the sly!",
  "Can you imagine!”",
  "",
  "Something in this story disposed Alice to not like Belinda but she couldn’t immediately articulate why, especially as the punch line to this story indicated that Belinda was not racist, and everyone else was laughing so hard.",
  "Anyhow Belinda had pulled all the attention into her orbit; there was no other conversation to escape to.",

  "“Oh no, I was at Oxford.” Belinda squinted at Alice. “And you’re from—somewhere stateside?”",

  "She recognized all the names Belinda dropped, she’d mentioned the right connections for Belinda to take her seriously, and she hadn’t managed to make a mess of her tea or her biscuit.",

  "Did they know that Peter Murdoch was the youngest person ever to publish in Arcana?",
  "Did they know Harvard had written to Peter Murdoch with a job offer after his Arcana paper came out, and that Peter had responded politely that he needed to finish his A-levels first?",

  "“He’s a magician made in a bottle.”",

  "“There you are.” Belinda shouted toward the garden gate, where stood a lanky young man who’d either forgotten or decided against wearing the requisite black gown.",
  "“Late as usual.",
  "Peter Murdoch, everyone.”",
  "",
  "The famous Peter Murdoch had overlong arms, overlong legs, and a wild bird’s nest of light brown hair under which sat a massive pair of wire spectacles.",
  "The lenses were very thick, which had the effect of making his brown eyes appear owlishly huge against his face.",
  "When he smiled his whole face split apart, revealing slightly uneven teeth.",
  "He looked like someone who wore a retainer.",
  "The overall effect was not unpleasant.",
  "He was decidedly no Greek god, and yet Alice could not stop staring at him.",
  "She kept looking him up and down, trying to determine if he was a real person.",
  "",
    "They all made their introductions.",
  "Peter was a cheerful, easy interlocutor.",
  "You got the sense, watching him nod and smile, that everything in the world was interesting to him.",
  "He kept asking everyone about their research, then asking follow-up questions about particular methods, but because everybody wanted to impress him and because the Italian (his name was Michele, Alice finally learned) went on and on so long about his work on rational choice theory, it was an eternity before Peter’s eyes alighted finally on Alice.",

  "Peter glanced over his shoulder and beamed at Alice.",
  "There, again, that disturbing thump of her heart.",
  "A spoon clinked against a glass, and someone announced it was time to for pre-drinks inside with the faculty.",
  "Alice squeezed her eyes shut and shook her head to clear it, and then followed them all through the doors.",
  "",
  "As it turned out the Pick meant the Pickerel Inn, which was just across the bridge from Magdalene College.",
  "The next day Alice arrived at five on the dot.",
  "She didn’t see Peter, so she took a table near the front where he couldn’t miss her.",

  "She almost never wore lipstick, and now she regretted it, but it would only make matters worse to wipe it off.",
  "She didn’t know why she felt so nervous; she’d had drinks with plenty of classmates before.",
  "Perhaps because they would be working so closely over the next six years—she badly wanted to start off on the right foot.",
  "Perhaps because she’d not stopped thinking about his crooked smile all night.",

  "Over the hour her nerves went from humming to frantic to completely shot.",
  "Peter never showed.",

  "She learned, over that first semester, that Peter Murdoch almost never showed up where or when he was supposed to.",
  "He was late to almost every lecture, absent for mandatory trainings, rarely at the lab when Professor Grimes expected them both.",
  "There was no pattern or explanation to this behavior.",
  "He would ignore you for weeks and suddenly show up with a beautifully complete research proposal.",

  "She had not thought to bring an umbrella, for she wasn’t used to this land of unannounced rains, and she walked home wet and shivering.",

  "From then on, if Peter was even two minutes late, she took that as confirmation he wasn’t coming at all.",
  "She was usually right.",

  "She ran through all sorts of theories that first year.",
  "Peter had some sort of short-term memory-loss problem—but then why did his lapses never extend to his coursework?",
  "Peter was living a double life as a government agent and could not keep track of his lies—but what life would that be, and what spy would choose to pose as a graduate student of all things?",
  "Peter had some sort of addiction problem.",
  "This suggestion was popular among the rest of the cohort—especially Belinda, who began fretting that Peter was on heroin—but the evidence simply didn’t exist.",
  "There were no track marks, no nosebleeds, no bizarre habits or bad breath.",
  "He was looking very thin—but then, he had always been very thin.",
  "Peter, when he showed up, was never anything but bright, focused, and alert.",
  "And so very nice.",
  "",
  "Most likely Peter was just that brilliant, arrogant, and absent-minded all at once; a combination of traits that only talented men like him could be, for the world forgave them any number of transgressions so long as they dazzled.",
  "For Peter, probably, making a date was the same thing as making small talk; it smoothed things over, and didn’t signify commitment.",
  "It wasn’t his fault.",
  "He wasn’t ignoring them on purpose.",
  "You couldn’t blame a typhoon for its casual destruction; you couldn’t fault the sun for disappearing the stars.",
  "He simply did not notice the consequences of his actions.",

  "His tap-dancing across the lab floor, singing out loud a song she had just started humming.",
  "Tossing chalk across the room when one of them had run out; reaching, missing, chalk scattered broken on the floor.",
  "And their exhausted, deranged laughter, in the late hours when everything seemed funny; the kind of hysterical, rib-aching laughter that left you unable to breathe.",

His parents are famous. Everyone in our field already knows his name. When he goes in for job interviews, he will know to ask about his colleagues’ children, because firstly he might already know them and secondly he will remind his interviewers of them. You, on the other hand. You don’t talk like them, you don’t look like them, and your research doesn’t fit what they’re looking for. You will always have to perform twice as well for half the acclaim. You have no room for mistakes.”",

So Chicago launches this whole investigation into Galloway, who might actually have been a lesbian, just not the predatory kind, and so she gets so scared off that she rescinds her job application, and Cadeaux gets the job, and no one knew any better until word got out he was bragging about it to graduate students at the pub. He'd made the whole thing up. He'd got his mum and sisters to handwrite anonymous letters and everything. Galloway found out and swore she'd ruin his career, except she died in a car accident before anyone could get to the bottom of things.\"",

But it all happened so quickly. One day, the strapping man I adored. The next, a skeleton. Then one night his heart stopped. I followed him to the next world. But this was not enough!\" Her silks turned pitch-black, heavy. \"He wanted to reincarnate. I could not. Our souls are not like those of humans; to be washed clean and plopped into new bodies to try again. I begged him to stay here with me. But he grew bored by sands with no ocean and a sky without stars. We thought once we had conversation enough to last through eternity. It turns out we couldn't even last the year.\" The Weaver Girl's voice shook. \"One day, I awoke and found he had abandoned me for the Lethe. Ever since I have roamed these fields alone. At the crossing from Desire to Greed, where desire runs dry, and lovers think only of themselves.\"",

  "A tear trickled glistening down her cheek.",

  "",
  "\"But still I am a romantic!\" The Weaver Girl spread her sleeves. A magnificent display of color. \"It was never wise for a deity to wed a mortal, I see that now. One needs a shared perspective on time. Deities do not love so fleetingly, so hopelessly, with every ounce of their soul. But humans—you live for a breath, you die, and you spend your whole lives wondering how you might stay together in the afterlife, when you don't even know if that's what you truly want.\"",

  "She drifted closer—uncomfortably close—and her long fingers stretched out to dance over their shoulders.",
  "Alice had the absurd fear she might knock their heads together and make them start kissing like dolls.",

Sometimes both parties die natural deaths, and one party waits years in the Fields of Asphodel until the other dies of old age.\" The Weaver Girl sighed. \"Everyone thinks their love is eternal. I like to let them keep believing.\"",
  "",
  "\"So let us through,\" said Peter. \"Love isn't a crime.\"",
  "\"Indeed it isn't,\" said the Weaver Girl. \"I do not inflict punishment, dear boy. I offer a solution.\" She clasped her hands together. \"I offer you a test. No arduous quest; only the answer to a question. I test your loyalty. If you pass, I build a bridge.\" She brought her hands together. Her fingers moved quick, and threads spilled out between them, conjuring just for a moment a fabric that rippled and glittered; twinkling gold and silver against velvety black. A carpet made of stars. \"My bridge will lead to any place you wish. Any boundary, any court. The Rebel Citadel, if you wish. Or straight to Lord Yama's throne. Pass, and I will let you walk this bridge just once, to any place you wish to go.\"",
  "",
  "\"What if we fail?\" asked Peter.",
  "\"Then, into the Lethe you go.\"",
  "\"But we're not dead,\" said Alice. \"We aren't Shades.\"",
  "\"Oh, you're sojourners!\" The Weaver Girl's hands flew to her mouth. Her eyes shone huge. \"But even better. Then you must really need safe passage.\" Her fingers danced; the bridge rippled over the abyss. \"These rocks are tricky, my loves. Prove your faith, and I'll send you safely through.\"",

  "\"Then we'll just win, it can't be hard—\"",
  "\"And that's supposing she's telling the truth,\" said Alice. \"Deities above don't wander often in Hell, you know—she could be in disguise—\"",
  "\"What else would she be?\"",
  "\"I don't know. Could be the sorcerer—\"",
  "\"If she's the sorcerer, we're screwed anyways! Look, Law.\" Peter spread his hands. \"This is a godsend. We're struggling enough as is, and she's promising safe passage—\"",
  "\"I don't want to get dropped into the river,\" said Alice. \"Which is, by the way, exactly what will happen, since we are not in love.\"",

  "\"What does that mean?\"",
  "\"Well, that we want all the same things. That we want what's best for each other. That we take one another's ends as our own, and that our ideal outcome is one in which we're together. Haven't you ever been in love?\"",
  "\"No. Have you?\"",
  "\"Well, no. But it can't be all that hard to imagine, can it?\"",
  "\"I think being in love might be the hardest thing to imagine.\" She paused, considering. \"I mean, the erotic complications alone. I haven't even seen your penis.\"",
  "\"Oh my God,\" said Peter. \"Law. We do not have time to articulate a philosophy of love.\"",
  "\"How else do we decide our dominant strategy, then?\"",
  "\"Just assume we are one person. Your ends are my ends and vice versa. What hurts you hurts me. Our goals are staying together, and pursuing what is best for ourselves as a joint unit.\"",

  "Alice did not think this was how real relationships worked, at least not from the ones she'd witnessed, but it did sound nice in theory.",
  "\"Where did you learn that?\"",
  "\"Immanuel Kant.\"",
  "\"Wasn't Kant a virgin?\"",
  "\"He was a great philosopher! He revolutionized metaphysics!\"",

  "To begin with, she did not in fact have an alternate account of love; but second, even if Peter's account of love made sense, she could not disentangle it from his possible ulterior motives for offering it.",

  "Swathes of silk shot up and made an opaque barrier between them.",
  "Peter yelled something, but his voice was muffled by the silk.",

  "The silks created silhouettes in the sky: two figures running toward each other and embracing, becoming one.",
  "\"Years passed when I did not see his face. His entire village begged him to forget me and marry—for I could not give him children, you see, nor fulfill any of the duties a wife should. And if ever he did not come, the bridge would break. If ever we were unfaithful, the bridge would break. We were never unfaithful. Always, we chose each other, until the end of his life. Until he chose differently, and condemned me.\"",

  "Dia hanya mondar-mandir di trotoar, berkedip melihat selembar kertas.",
  "Dada Alice mengencang.",
  "Dia tidak memiliki kelas dengan Peter semester itu, dan dia belum berbicara dengannya sejak acara teh orientasi itu, meskipun hatinya selalu berdetak aneh ketika dia melihatnya sekilas di sekitar kampus.",

  "“Dunia akan jauh lebih mudah baginya,” Professor Grimes melanjutkan. “Dia terlihat, bertindak, dan berbicara seperti penyihir. Dia melakukan jenis penelitian klasik yang disukai Royal Academy. Orang tuanya terkenal. Semua orang di bidang kita sudah tahu namanya. Ketika dia pergi untuk wawancara kerja, dia akan tahu untuk bertanya tentang anak-anak koleganya, karena pertama-tama dia mungkin sudah mengenal mereka dan kedua dia akan mengingatkan pewawancaranya tentang mereka. Kau, di sisi lain. Kau tidak berbicara seperti mereka, kau tidak terlihat seperti mereka, dan penelitianmu tidak cocok dengan apa yang mereka cari. Kau akan selalu harus tampil dua kali lebih baik untuk separuh pujian. Kau tidak memiliki ruang untuk kesalahan.”",

  "\"Aku tidak mengatakan ini untuk membuatmu patah semangat,\" kata Professor Grimes. \"Aku mengatakan ini karena aku pernah berada di posisimu. Kau dan aku—kita tidak begitu diberkati. Kita harus memanjat jalan kita ke atas. Kau melakukan pekerjaan yang bagus, Law. Tapi itulah masalahnya. Itu hanya bagus. Aku butuh kau menjadi luar biasa.\"",
  "\"Aku bisa menjadi luar biasa,\" kata Alice, karena itu sepertinya satu-satunya balasan yang bisa dia berikan.",

Dia mengada-ada semuanya. Dia menyuruh ibu dan saudara perempuannya untuk menulis surat anonim dan segalanya. Galloway mengetahuinya dan bersumpah akan menghancurkan kariernya, kecuali dia meninggal dalam kecelakaan mobil sebelum siapa pun bisa menyelidiki sampai tuntas.\"",

  "\"Apa maksudnya?\"",
  "\"Yah, bahwa kita menginginkan semua hal yang sama. Bahwa kita menginginkan yang terbaik untuk satu sama lain. Bahwa kita mengambil tujuan satu sama lain sebagai milik kita sendiri, dan bahwa hasil ideal kita adalah di mana kita bersama. Pernahkah kau jatuh cinta?\"",
  "\"Tidak. Kau?\"",
  "\"Yah, tidak. Tapi itu tidak terlalu sulit untuk dibayangkan, bukan?\"",
  "\"Kupikir jatuh cinta mungkin adalah hal yang paling sulit untuk dibayangkan.\" Dia berhenti, mempertimbangkan. \"Maksudku, komplikasi erotisnya saja. Aku bahkan belum melihat penismu.\"",
  "\"Ya Tuhan,\" kata Peter. \"Law. Kita tidak punya waktu untuk mengartikulasikan filosofi cinta.\"",
  "\"Lalu bagaimana lagi kita memutuskan strategi dominan kita?\"",
  "\"Anggap saja kita adalah satu orang. Tujuanmu adalah tujuanku dan sebaliknya. Apa yang menyakitimu menyakitiku. Tujuan kita adalah tetap bersama, dan mengejar yang terbaik untuk diri kita sendiri sebagai unit bersama.\"",

  "\"Tahun-tahun berlalu ketika aku tidak melihat wajahnya. Seluruh desanya memohon padanya untuk melupakanku dan menikah—karena aku tidak bisa memberinya anak, kau tahu, juga tidak memenuhi salah satu kewajiban yang seharusnya dilakukan seorang istri.

                  "In the winter of their first year, Professor Grimes’s head lab assistant—a fourth-year named Joshua—abruptly quit the program and fled to Canada.",
  "It was a big scandal at the time.",
  "Rumor had it Joshua’s pregnant girlfriend, fed up with his long hours, imposed an ultimatum that he needed to pay more attention to her and, when that didn’t work, packed everything up and fled to her parents’ home in Ottawa.",
  "Joshua dropped everything for love and followed her there.",
  "This involved spending all his savings on a last-minute flight and racing to Heathrow at midnight.",
  "It was not this drama but the fact that anyone would leave Cambridge for Canada that got the department in a tizzy.",
  "Did Canada even have universities, or did everyone just ski and eat maple syrup and run away from bears all year round?",
  "Anyhow, as far as anyone knew Joshua was now happily married and working as a tour guide at the Château Laurier.",
  "",
  "The relevant part was that Joshua left without wrapping up his projects, or indeed even informing Professor Grimes that he was leaving.",
  "This would have been salvageable, if Professor Grimes were not on deadline for a conference presentation at the Royal Academy of Magick in London.",
  "",
  "Alice and Peter were thus recruited to fill in the gaps.",
  "They champed at the bit.",
  "Who cared if it was unpaid overtime?",
  "Who cared if it meant thirty extra hours a week for which they would not be credited, at the same time that they were still burdened with coursework?",
  "Professor Grimes wanted their help with real research!",
  "The thing they’d trained their whole lives to do!",
  "They would have been such fools to say no.",
  "",
  "They were only friendly acquaintances when they began the work.",
  "Alice had seen little of Peter since their first encounter in the garden, as their classes kept taking them in separate directions.",
  "She approached their first meeting with trepidation.",
  "What if Peter condescended to her?",
  "Worse off, what if she came off as stupid?",
  "",
  "She needn’t have worried.",
  "Difficulty had a way of forging fast friendships; there was no time for interpersonal awkwardness when there was so much to do.",
  "How pleasant was the exhaustion of those first days.",
  "Every day at five Alice and Peter met in Professor Grimes’s basement laboratory, loaded down with stacks of manuscripts, hands dusty with chalk.",
  "Those nights they worked frantically for hours and hours until they couldn’t see straight.",
  "Those nights they spent on the floor of the lab laughing at their own mistakes, eating chips and curry from halal carts and sometimes, if they felt like treating themselves, chicken tikka masala from the Indian place up north of the bridge.",
  "This was the best life had to offer: chalk smears on their faces, turmeric-stained fingerprints on graph paper.",
  "Complete happiness was some form of study, said Aristotle.",
  "And they were so happy; covering entire blackboards with chalk in an inspired frenzy, then erasing the whole thing to start over again.",
  "Suppressing their giggles, putting on a straight face every time they heard Professor Grimes’s footsteps coming down the stairs.",
  "",
  "It was in the midnight hours, when the mind fractured and things stopped making sense and the boundaries of the possible became fluid, that they did their best work.",
  "And in these hours, Alice experienced for the first time what she thought it might be like to fall in love.",
  "",
  "She was not new to the language of courtship.",
  "There were boyfriends in high school, boyfriends in college; nervous young men in button-downs smelling of aftershave who traipsed one after another in a forgettable procession of silent films, fumbling hands.",
  "Dimly she understood this kind of socializing turned into “going steady,” into marriage—she just couldn’t understand how, when it all felt an exercise in concealing your distaste.",
  "Peter did not belong to this genre.",
  "This was an entirely different type of feeling, and Alice could not consign what they had to the trash heap of romance.",
  "This was love, a love she had never known; At last, she thought, this is the real thing—this gradual unfolding of another soul, charting one’s course into privileged inner territory, making discoveries of which you felt you were the first.",
  "Alice loved her work for just this reason, so why wouldn’t she fall in love with people, too?",
  "",
  "She learned that Peter liked to hum Mendelssohn as he worked, but would blush and stop if she started humming along.",
  "She learned that Peter loved lentils, but hated mashed potatoes and bananas because they had a quality he found “deceptively mushy.”",
  "She learned that at approximately two in the morning Peter transitioned into what they called his “manic state,” which was when his hair fluffed up and his eyes went wide and started windmilling and he got so excited about everything they were working on that he was unable to communicate with anything more than a frenzied, “AHHH!”",
  "",
  "And if falling in love was discovery, was letting yourself be discovered the equivalent to being loved?",
  "For it tickled Alice to hear Peter make observations about her; to announce facts she’d never noticed about herself.",
  "Did she know, for instance, that she flopped her hands like a jellyfish whenever she disagreed with an argument?",
  "Did she know that she always ended up with the same diagonal streak across her forehead, left by pushing her hair back with the same chalky fingers?",
  "Peter determined that when Alice got sleepy, she lied—not in any malicious way, but in absurd ways; words just streamed from her half-conscious mouth in no sensical order.",
  "He was so amused by Alice’s unconscious lying that for weeks he recorded the sillier things she said, all so he could announce at the end of the month: “I have concluded that your lying, sleeping self has a single motive.",
  "And it is to continue sleeping for as long as possible.",
  "You will answer in any way that convinces your interlocutor to leave you alone.",
  "For instance, see here, my transcript from Wednesday—I ask you if you are an eggplant.",
  "And you agree you are an eggplant, but that I shouldn’t worry, and that everything is fine.",
  "In the past month I have heard you agree that you are the princess of Belgravia, that your toes are really baby hamsters, and that over the holidays, you will join me skiing on the sun.",
  "You are incorrigible, Law.",
  "Your unconscious id is fiercely protective of being left alone.”",
  "",
  "There were no thoughts they could not share.",
  "They reached that rare state of comfort with another person, in which speaking out loud was just the same as thinking in your head—nothing filtered, nothing hidden.",
  "Often, instead of going home to sleep, they would stay up until the latest hours of the morning talking.",
  "They argued over the Monty Hall problem.",
  "Peter thought it obvious you should switch; Alice refused to be convinced.",
  "They argued over whether numbers had colors and personalities.",
  "Peter insisted they did: three was blue, five was red, two was yellow, and four was orange; eight was a ponderous bore, and nine was a voluptuous seductress—and what color?",
  "Oh, obviously, burgundy.",
  "Nine was wine.",
  "Alice thought he was making this up for attention.",
  "They argued over whether, on the question of language’s relationship to reality, Wittgenstein and Lacan were climbing the same mountain from different sides (possibly, they concluded, but neither of them could comprehend Lacan well enough to say for certain).",
  "",
  "Peter was the best kind of interlocutor: generous, open-minded, inquisitive.",
  "He thought every new discipline was fascinating, and he asked her questions about her own field she’d never considered before.",
  "",
  "“What’s Jakobson say about language?” he would ask.",
  "“What’s metonymy?",
  "What’s metaphor?",
  "What does it mean for the unconscious to be structured like a language?",
  "What is a language?”",
  "",
  "When they spoke he would stare, unblinking, at her face in a manner that, every now and then, made her stutter and drop what she was holding.",
  "It was hard for her to receive Peter’s attention.",
  "She had wondered for so long what it would take to get it, and now, although she had it in spades, it paralyzed her.",
  "",
  "He taught her that maths could be fun, sometimes, so long as you were solving paradoxes about potatoes.",
  "Suppose you have a hundred kilos of potatoes.",
  "They are 99 percent water.",
  "Suppose overnight they dry, so that they are now only 98 percent water.",
  "How many kilos of potatoes do you have?",
  "Only fifty!",
  "Fifty?",
  "Yes, fifty, down from one hundred!",
  "But you’ve only lost 1 percent water.",
  "But how could this be?",
  "“It’s simple arithmetic,” he said, but Alice did not believe.",
  "",
    "Alice, in turn, taught him about Chinese acrostic poems—written so as to be intelligible no matter which direction you read them in.",
  "She taught him about the intricacies of Chinese grammar, or really how there was none, and how in Chinese the conceptual metaphors for time and space were the opposite of in English.",
  "The Chinese believe you can see the past, but not the future, she explained; therefore you can only walk backward into the future.",
  "And Peter, fascinated, declared he was going to learn Chinese so he could understand her better, until a brief exercise with tones—and tone-deafness—disabused him of the hope it could be so easy.",
  "",
  "Back then they even developed their own shorthand language, an idiotic combination of symbolic logic—which was just funny to utter out loud—and French, which only Alice spoke and which Peter thought sounded funny.",
  "There was a lot of honking, in lieu of actual French.",
  "This language was not at all efficient, but it amused them; it made them feel even more that they existed on a mental plane removed from everyone else, that soon they would disappear into their own symbolic order and never be understood by anyone else again but each other.",
  "",
  "Often they descended into incoherent laughter.",
  "Oh, how she loved his laugh.",
  "At a certain point past midnight when their minds were addled they would start to giggle at everything, but every now and then Alice said something so absurd it made Peter erupt into helpless, full-body laughter.",
  "It lurched through him, syncopated his breath, made his arms flail, elbows up before his chest like if he didn’t try to hold himself together that laughter would break him into a million pieces.",
  "When Peter laughed it felt like the entire warmth of the sun was turned on her, because she had done it, she had uttered the words that so surprised and delighted him that he couldn’t even breathe.",
  "",
  "There was a time when she felt all she ever wanted to do was to make Peter Murdoch laugh.",
  "",
  "Just as often, they fell into a happy silence as they worked.",
  "They could go for hours without speaking; they’d developed such a comfortable natural rhythm around each other.",
  "All Alice needed for company was the confident scribble of Peter’s chalk beside her.",
  "She was not alone.",
  "She was safe.",
  "There was at least a single other soul in this universe who vibrated at her same frequency.",
  "And really that was the happiest Alice had ever felt—how wonderful, truly, to have a friend whose silence you adored.",
  "",
  "Anyhow.",
  "",
  "All this happened before the period when Alice remembered everything, so it was a mere fog to her now.",
  "And even if she could remember, she suspected it would feel absurdly distant no matter what, like a life lived by two entirely different people—younger, happier, more innocent people.",
  "They were not the same people.",
  "Distant cousins, maybe.",
  "Passing resemblance.",
  "",
  "How quickly things could change.",
  "The term ended.",
  "The project concluded.",
  "Professor Grimes gave his presentation in Bruges to a standing ovation, and Alice and Peter no longer had any reason to grind midnights at the lab.",
  "And instantly, Peter pulled away.",
  "",
  "It took Alice far too long to get the hint.",
  "Fool that she was, she thought their friendship extended outside the lab; that whatever had happened across all those midnight hours would endure.",
  "She thought he’d felt it too.",
  "They had no classes together, but she invented reasons to come across him.",
  "She started lingering in the graduate students’ lounge, just in case he came in for a coffee.",
  "Weeknights she would swing by the halal cart hoping she would find him ordering his usual chips and curry.",
  "She had no particular goal in mind.",
  "Nothing so concrete as a dinner date.",
  "Nothing so bold.",
  "She had not thought that far; the question did not even take form.",
  "She only wanted to hear him laugh.",
  "",
  "But he was never there.",
  "",
  "She could not blame him for this.",
  "Their teaching schedules did not overlap.",
  "They shared no lab assignments, nor were they taking any classes together.",
  "There was no reason they ought to spend time together, except that she had enjoyed it, and wanted to do it more.",
  "But he had not promised her his time.",
  "He did not owe her anything.",
  "He was busy, they all were, and increasingly so as their responsibilities doubled.",
  "She couldn’t begrudge him that.",
  "",
  "But even this did not account for the way he behaved when their paths did cross.",
  "When they walked past one another in the hallway—one leaving Grimes’s office, one about to enter—he only nodded.",
  "When they attended the same department functions, they exchanged nothing but bland pleasantries.",
  "Hi, how are you? Fine, yeah, same old, grinding away—great, yeah, good to see you, take care.",
  "She cracked jokes, references meant only for him, but he did not laugh, or did not hear.",
  "On many occasions she lingered at doorways, hoping to walk out with him, but he walked past without seeing her.",
  "",
  "It was so humiliating the way she’d lingered, hoping for his attention—like a dog that didn’t know that it had been abandoned, that kept on coming back.",
  "He was not rude to her.",
  "In fact he was perfectly polite, wearing that classic Murdoch smile.",
  "He gave her the same kind attentiveness that he would to any stranger.",
  "",
  "But this hurt, for she had thought they were anything but.",
  "",
  "And when at last the fact of the matter sank in—that Peter did not wish to see her, and did not hold her in special regard—she still could not wrap her mind around it.",
  "She could not understand how you could open your mind to someone so completely, for so long, and then slam it shut again.",
  "",
  "She wanted to ask him what had happened but could not formulate the question in a way that wasn’t childish.",
  "Why don’t you like me anymore? Why don’t you want to be my friend?",
  "Questions for the playground; pathetic utterances.",
  "She would not say them, she would not confirm for him that she was too dull for his attention.",
  "",
  "That following term she cycled through every emotion she might have felt toward Peter—disappointment, anger, resentment, longing—a whole slew of one-sided angst.",
  "But above all she was confused.",
  "All the walls were up.",
  "She had been thrown out in the cold.",
  "An abyss lay between them, and she did not know how she had caused this.",
  "",

  "Let the record display she did not give up so easily on love: that she actually did try to sit down, hammer it all out, and understand what was going on.",
  "Peter was still avoiding her, so she slipped a note into his pidge instead.",

  "That summer, the philosopher Derek Parfit published the very controversial Reasons and Persons, and for a while it was all that anyone at Cambridge or Oxford would talk about.",
  "Alice read it with great interest.",
  "In fact, it helped her sort through much of her confusion.",
  "Reasons and Persons argues for a reductionist account of personal identity: that is to say, no special essence of personhood that remains stable across one’s lifetime.",
  "Using a number of thought experiments involving brain transplants, brain divisions, and tele-transportation, Parfit argued that the qualities which we think define essential personhood—psychological connectedness, for instance—do not actually ground any deeper fact.",
  "We might share the same cells, bodily continuity, and memories as previous iterations of ourselves.",
  "But that is all.",
  "There is no further fact of the matter—no essential us hovering like a specter.",
  "We bear the same relationship to the version of ourselves from ten years ago as we might to a sibling.",
  "",
  "Now, Alice did not understand much about moral philosophy, and she was inclined to be skeptical that some thought experiments about tele-transportation could disprove the idea of an immortal soul, but she did find this perspective liberating.",
  "It helped her understand that she had never really known Peter, and he had never really known her.",
  "She knew only a version of him, at a brief moment in time.",
  "But without those hazy recollections, without the historical fact that she had once giggled helplessly with her head lolling on Peter’s shoulder, she had no significant relationship to the Alice Law who was falling in love with Peter Murdoch at all.",
  "And if you could constantly reinvent yourself, cut away the parts of you that ashamed or hurt you, then how could you ever come to really know someone else?",
  "Were people all just living paradoxes, keeping up an illusion just long enough to survive contact with others?",
  "Were people then all a series of lies in the end?",
  "",
  "And if that was true—then what difference did it make, what history you had, what love you’d shared?",
  "That staircase was gone; the planks had reassembled, and the soul you had come to know was a newly crafted fiction.",
  "And so perhaps it was entirely possible—common, even—for you to look into the eyes of someone you’d been falling in love with, someone you had spent every waking moment with, whose breathing sounded as familiar as your own—and fail to recognize them at all."

  "Samar-samar dia mengerti sosialisasi semacam ini berubah menjadi “pacaran serius,” menjadi pernikahan—dia hanya tidak bisa mengerti bagaimana caranya, ketika semuanya terasa seperti latihan menyembunyikan rasa tidak suka.",

  "Ini adalah jenis perasaan yang sama sekali berbeda, dan Alice tidak bisa membuang apa yang mereka miliki ke tumpukan sampah romansa.",
  "Inilah cinta, cinta yang belum pernah dia kenal; Akhirnya, pikirnya, inilah hal yang nyata—terbukanya jiwa lain secara bertahap, memetakan jalan seseorang ke wilayah batin yang istimewa, membuat penemuan-penemuan yang kau rasa kaulah yang pertama.",

  "Tahukah dia bahwa dia selalu berakhir dengan guratan diagonal yang sama di dahinya, ditinggalkan oleh dorongan rambut ke belakang dengan jari-jari berkapur yang sama?",
  "Peter menetapkan bahwa ketika Alice mengantuk, dia berbohong—bukan dengan cara yang jahat, tetapi dengan cara yang tidak masuk akal; kata-kata mengalir begitu saja dari mulut setengah sadarnya tanpa urutan yang masuk akal.",
  "Dia begitu terhibur oleh kebohongan bawah sadar Alice sehingga selama berminggu-minggu dia merekam hal-hal konyol yang dikatakannya, semuanya agar dia bisa mengumumkan di akhir bulan: “Aku telah menyimpulkan bahwa dirimu yang berbohong saat tidur memiliki satu motif tunggal.",
  "Dan itu adalah untuk terus tidur selama mungkin.",
  "Kau akan menjawab dengan cara apa pun yang meyakinkan lawan bicaramu untuk meninggalkanmu sendirian.",
  "Misalnya, lihat di sini, transkripku dari hari Rabu—Aku bertanya padamu apakah kau terung.",

  "Alice, pada gilirannya, mengajarinya tentang puisi akrostik Tiongkok—ditulis agar dapat dipahami tidak peduli dari arah mana kau membacanya.",

  "Orang Tiongkok percaya kau bisa melihat masa lalu, tetapi tidak masa depan, jelasnya; oleh karena itu kau hanya bisa berjalan mundur ke masa depan.",
  "Dan Peter, yang terpesona, menyatakan dia akan belajar bahasa Tiongkok agar bisa memahaminya lebih baik, sampai latihan singkat dengan nada—dan ketidakpekaan nada—menyadarkannya dari harapan bahwa itu akan mudah.",
  "",
  "Saat itu mereka bahkan mengembangkan bahasa sandi mereka sendiri, kombinasi konyol dari logika simbolis—yang lucu untuk diucapkan dengan keras—dan bahasa Prancis, yang hanya dikuasai Alice dan menurut Peter terdengar lucu.",
  "Ada banyak suara 'honk', sebagai pengganti bahasa Prancis yang sebenarnya.",
  "Bahasa ini sama sekali tidak efisien, tetapi menghibur mereka; itu membuat mereka semakin merasa bahwa mereka ada di alam mental yang terpisah dari orang lain, bahwa mereka akan segera menghilang ke dalam tatanan simbolis mereka sendiri dan tidak akan pernah dipahami oleh orang lain lagi selain satu sama lain.",
 "",
  "Seringkali mereka tertawa terbahak-bahak tak terkendali.",
  "Oh, betapa dia menyukai tawanya.",
  "Pada titik tertentu lewat tengah malam ketika pikiran mereka kacau, mereka akan mulai terkikik pada segalanya, tetapi sesekali Alice mengatakan sesuatu yang begitu absurd sehingga membuat Peter meledak dalam tawa tak berdaya, tawa yang mengguncang seluruh tubuh.",
 "Tawa itu menyentak, membuat napasnya tersengal-sengal, membuat lengannya mengepak, siku terangkat di depan dada seolah jika ia tidak berusaha menahan diri, tawa itu akan menghancurkannya berkeping-keping.",
"Ketika Peter tertawa, rasanya seperti seluruh kehangatan matahari tertuju padanya, karena dia telah melakukannya, dia telah mengucapkan kata-kata yang begitu mengejutkan dan menyenangkannya sehingga dia bahkan tidak bisa bernapas.",
  "",
  "Ada suatu masa ketika dia merasa yang dia inginkan hanyalah membuat Peter Murdoch tertawa.",
  "",
  "Sama seringnya, mereka jatuh dalam keheningan yang membahagiakan saat bekerja.",
  "Mereka bisa berjam-jam tanpa berbicara; mereka telah mengembangkan ritme alami yang begitu nyaman di sekitar satu sama lain.",
  "Yang dibutuhkan Alice untuk menemaninya hanyalah coretan kapur Peter yang mantap di sampingnya.",
 "Dia tidak sendirian.",

  "",
  "Bagaimanapun.",
  "",
  "Semua ini terjadi sebelum periode ketika Alice mengingat segalanya, jadi itu hanyalah kabut baginya sekarang.",
 "Dan bahkan jika dia bisa mengingatnya, dia curiga itu akan terasa sangat jauh bagaimanapun juga, seperti kehidupan yang dijalani oleh dua orang yang sama sekali berbeda—orang yang lebih muda, lebih bahagia, lebih polos.",
  "Mereka bukan orang yang sama.",
  "Sepupu jauh, mungkin.",
  "Kemiripan sekilas.",
  "",
"Betapa cepatnya segala sesuatu bisa berubah.",
  "Semester berakhir.",
  "Proyek selesai.",
  "Profesor Grimes memberikan presentasinya di Bruges yang disambut tepuk tangan meriah, dan Alice serta Peter tidak lagi punya alasan untuk bekerja keras hingga tengah malam di lab.",
  "Dan seketika itu juga, Peter menarik diri.",
  "",
  "Butuh waktu terlalu lama bagi Alice untuk menangkap isyarat itu.",
  "Bodohnya dia, dia pikir persahabatan mereka berlanjut di luar lab; bahwa apa pun yang telah terjadi selama berjam-jam tengah malam itu akan bertahan lama.",

  "Mereka tidak punya kelas bersama, tetapi dia menciptakan alasan untuk bertemu dengannya.",
  "Dia mulai berlama-lama di ruang tunggu mahasiswa pascasarjana, siapa tahu dia masuk untuk minum kopi.",

"Dia tidak punya tujuan khusus.",
  "Tidak ada yang sekonkret kencan makan malam.",

  "Dia tidak berpikir sejauh itu; pertanyaan itu bahkan tidak terbentuk.",

  "Dia tidak berutang apa pun padanya.",
  "Dia sibuk, mereka semua sibuk, dan semakin sibuk seiring tanggung jawab mereka berlipat ganda.",
  "Dia tidak bisa membencinya karena itu.",
  "",
"Tetapi bahkan ini tidak menjelaskan cara dia berperilaku ketika jalan mereka bersilangan.",
  "Ketika mereka berpapasan di lorong—satu meninggalkan kantor Grimes, satu akan masuk—dia hanya mengangguk.",
  "Ketika mereka menghadiri acara departemen yang sama, mereka tidak bertukar apa pun selain basa-basi hambar.",
  "Hai, apa kabar? Baik, ya, seperti biasa, sibuk bekerja—bagus, ya, senang bertemu denganmu, hati-hati.",
  "Dia melontarkan lelucon, referensi yang hanya ditujukan untuknya, tetapi dia tidak tertawa, atau tidak mendengar.",
  "Sering kali dia berlama-lama di ambang pintu, berharap bisa berjalan keluar bersamanya, tetapi dia berjalan melewatinya tanpa melihatnya.",
  "",
  "Sangat memalukan caranya berlama-lama, mengharapkan perhatiannya—seperti anjing yang tidak tahu bahwa ia telah ditinggalkan, yang terus saja kembali.",
 "Dia tidak kasar padanya.",
  "Bahkan dia sangat sopan, mengenakan senyum klasik Murdoch itu.",
  "Dia memberinya perhatian ramah yang sama seperti yang akan dia berikan kepada orang asing.",
  "",
  "Tapi ini menyakitkan, karena dia pikir mereka jauh dari itu.",
  "",
  "Dan ketika akhirnya kenyataan itu meresap—bahwa Peter tidak ingin bertemu dengannya, dan tidak menganggapnya istimewa—dia masih tidak bisa memahaminya.",
 "Dia tidak bisa mengerti bagaimana kau bisa membuka pikiranmu kepada seseorang begitu sepenuhnya, begitu lama, dan kemudian membantingnya hingga tertutup lagi.",
  "",
  "Dia ingin bertanya kepadanya apa yang telah terjadi tetapi tidak bisa merumuskan pertanyaan itu dengan cara yang tidak kekanak-kanakan.",
  "Kenapa kau tidak menyukaiku lagi? Kenapa kau tidak mau berteman denganku?",
  "Pertanyaan untuk taman bermain; ucapan yang menyedihkan.",
  "Dia tidak akan mengatakannya, dia tidak akan mengkonfirmasi kepadanya bahwa dia terlalu membosankan untuk perhatiannya.",
"",
  "Semester berikutnya dia mengalami setiap emosi yang mungkin dia rasakan terhadap Peter—kekecewaan, kemarahan, kebencian, kerinduan—segala macam kecemasan sepihak.",
  "Tapi di atas semua itu dia bingung.",
  "Semua dinding telah terpasang.",
  "Dia telah dibuang kedinginan.",
  "Sebuah jurang terbentang di antara mereka, dan dia tidak tahu bagaimana dia telah menyebabkannya.",
 "",
  "Lalu dia pergi ke Venesia.",
  "Kemudian beberapa hal terjadi di Venesia, dan Alice mulai merasa segalanya terlepas darinya.",
  "Itulah awalnya, dia sadari sejak saat itu; saat dia mengetahui bahwa jika menyangkut Profesor Grimes, dia benar-benar tidak punya kemampuan untuk berkata tidak.",
 "",
  "Dan kemudian dia kembali, dan semuanya menjadi kacau, dan selama setahun terakhir, Alice tidak bisa berpapasan dengan Peter di lorong tanpa mengalihkan pandangannya.",
 "",
  "Ada suatu masa ketika segalanya serba salah, Alice mencoba memperbaikinya.",
  "Biar catatan menunjukkan dia tidak menyerah begitu saja pada cinta: bahwa dia benar-benar mencoba untuk duduk, menyelesaikan semuanya, dan mengerti apa yang sedang terjadi.",
 "Peter masih menghindarinya, jadi dia menyelipkan catatan ke *pidge*-nya.",
  "Dia meletakkannya tepat di atas tumpukan surat-menyuratnya, tempat di mana dia tidak mungkin tidak melihatnya.",
  "Sudah lama, tulisnya.",

  "Minum teh.",

  "Dia melihat catatan itu.",

 "",
  "Jika dia memiliki ingatan sempurnanya saat itu, maka dia bisa memilah-milah interaksi mereka—semua malam-malam itu, semua senyuman itu—untuk mencari petunjuk, jika bukan hanya untuk kenyamanan bernostalgia.",
  "Tapi yang dia miliki sekarang hanyalah anggukan dingin di lorong; sapaan singkat; dan kibasan mantelnya, bagian belakang kepalanya, saat dia bergegas keluar pintu.",
  "",
  "Dan kemudian gosip; sindiran, tawa.",
  "Langkah kaki menghilang di lorong.",
  "",
  "Musim panas itu, filsuf Derek Parfit menerbitkan *Reasons and Persons* yang sangat kontroversial, dan untuk sementara waktu hanya itulah yang dibicarakan semua orang di Cambridge atau Oxford.",
"Alice membacanya dengan penuh minat.",
  "Faktanya, itu membantunya memilah-milah kebingungannya.",
  "*Reasons and Persons* berpendapat untuk penjelasan reduksionis tentang identitas pribadi: artinya, tidak ada esensi khusus dari kepribadian yang tetap stabil sepanjang hidup seseorang.",
 "Menggunakan sejumlah eksperimen pikiran yang melibatkan transplantasi otak, pembelahan otak, dan tele-transportasi, Parfit berpendapat bahwa kualitas-kualitas yang kita pikir mendefinisikan kepribadian esensial—keterhubungan psikologis, misalnya—sebenarnya tidak mendasari fakta yang lebih dalam.",
 "Kita mungkin berbagi sel yang sama, kesinambungan tubuh, dan ingatan sebagai iterasi diri kita sebelumnya.",
  "Tapi hanya itu.",
  "Tidak ada fakta lebih lanjut—tidak ada 'kita' esensial yang melayang seperti hantu.",
 "Kita memiliki hubungan yang sama dengan versi diri kita sepuluh tahun yang lalu seperti halnya kita dengan saudara kandung.",
  "",
  "Sekarang, Alice tidak terlalu mengerti tentang filsafat moral, dan dia cenderung skeptis bahwa beberapa eksperimen pikiran tentang tele-transportasi dapat menyangkal gagasan tentang jiwa abadi, tetapi dia menemukan perspektif ini membebaskan.",
  "Itu membantunya mengerti bahwa dia tidak pernah benar-benar mengenal Peter, dan Peter tidak pernah benar-benar mengenalnya.",
  "Dia hanya mengenal versi dirinya, pada saat yang singkat.",
  "Tetapi tanpa ingatan samar-samar itu, tanpa fakta sejarah bahwa dia pernah terkikik tak berdaya dengan kepala terkulai di bahu Peter, dia sama sekali tidak memiliki hubungan yang signifikan dengan Alice Law yang sedang jatuh cinta pada Peter Murdoch.",
 "Dan jika kau bisa terus-menerus menemukan kembali dirimu, memotong bagian-bagian dirimu yang mempermalukan atau menyakitimu, lalu bagaimana kau bisa benar-benar mengenal orang lain?",
  "Apakah orang-orang hanyalah paradoks hidup, mempertahankan ilusi cukup lama untuk bertahan dari kontak dengan orang lain?",
"Apakah orang-orang pada akhirnya hanyalah serangkaian kebohongan?",
  "",
  "Dan jika itu benar—lalu apa bedanya, sejarah apa yang kau miliki, cinta apa yang telah kau bagi?",
"Tangga itu sudah hilang; papan-papannya telah tersusun kembali, dan jiwa yang kau kenal adalah fiksi yang baru dibuat.",
  "Dan jadi mungkin saja—bahkan umum—bagimu untuk menatap mata seseorang yang membuatmu jatuh cinta, seseorang yang telah menghabiskan setiap saat terjagamu bersamanya, yang napasnya terdengar sama familiernya dengan napasmu sendiri—dan gagal mengenali mereka sama sekali."

  "The bone-things were most interested in Peter.",
  "Alice they largely ignored; they skirted right past her to get to him.",

  "“Here—” Alice tried to slide him a knife, but they were too many; they swarmed the blade the moment she set it down.",
  "With shaking hands she uncapped her flask.",

  "Peter cried out in pain.",
  "A bone dog had landed on his back, its teeth fixed in his collarbone.",

  "She anticipated excruciating pain, a million tiny bites.",
  "But perhaps the shock or blood loss would numb her first, perhaps her consciousness would fade.",
  "And then the rest, easy, like going to sleep.",
  "But the pain never came.",
  "A thousand tiny pressures against her side; snouts digging not into but beneath her.",
  "Suddenly they lifted her up.",

  "Alice writhed, but it was pointless.",
  "Any way she turned another mass of bone was ready to catch her, jolt her back into its center.",
  "The dim sun spun overhead, sharp ledges against the orange sky, which disoriented her so she had no idea where they were going except the vague sensation they were traveling down, down, deeper along the cliffs until she could hear the churning Lethe roaring by her ears, the mist against her cheek.",
  "The bone things turned sharply.",
  "Down the bank, Alice glimpsed a bone-thing larger than the rest; a chimeric amalgamation standing upright on two legs, its head an enormous, fanged skull.",

  "A horn’s blow pierced the air.",

  "On deck stood a single boatman, outfitted much the same way; a ragtag pirate from no era or nation, just the detritus of the underworld.",
  "A mask of bone covered the top half of his face, leaving visible only an eager, grinning mouth.",
  "",
  "“Away! Back!”",
  "",
  "The boatman sprang gracefully onto the shore and, in one fluid motion, drew a spear from his back.",
  "He spun it round twice above his head—a bit showy, Alice thought—and then jumped out and swung it so quickly toward Alice that it nearly scraped her nose.",
  "A crunch, a whine.",
  "The bone-thing by Alice’s chest shattered to pieces at her feet.",

  "He’d made the opening volley.",
  "The bone-things responded in kind.",

  "He was wonderful to watch.",
  "The bone-things redoubled their attack, but the boatman seemed well practiced at their maneuvers.",
  "They lunged from every angle, but he anticipated their blows—smacking their joints, their spines, all those sticking points that held the rest together.",

  "He jammed the rod through the ribs of the one straddling Alice and yanked.",

  "\"Who doesn't? Here, sweetie.\"",
  "Elspeth held out her arms.",
  "Archimedes jumped up and snuggled against her chest.",
  "\"So. Ramanujan, was it? Yes. Clever. You're the first pair I've seen who've actually managed it, you know. Everyone always gets stuck on Setiya's Modifications, they don't have the maths for it.\"",
  "The words rushed out Elspeth's mouth without pause or punctuation; she seemed unaware she was speaking in full paragraphs.",
  "Perhaps a decade of loneliness did that to you.",
  "Perhaps they were the only souls Elspeth had spoken to since her death.",
  "Her gaze darted eagerly between them, drinking in their faces.",
  "\"Journeying to Hell was all the craze during my days. Everyone kept threatening to do it, but no one ever managed it, and the first few years I sat at that bridge watching and waiting for someone to make it over. Five years in I figured they'd just stopped trying. So how much did it cost you?\"",

  "All this she uttered without any semblance of tact.",

  "\"You've met them before, clearly—\"",
  "",
  "\"Oh, I call them little rovers.\"",
  "Elspeth made a face.",
  "\"Apparatuses of bone. Set in motion with power beyond me—but they're scared of the Lethe, as you've noticed. That helps. I've been collecting spray bottles for ages.\"",

  "Elspeth lowered the staff.",
  "\"Have either of you ever heard of the Kripkes?\"",
  "",
  "\"No,\"",
  "said Peter, as Alice said, \"Oh, Jesus.\"",
  "",
  "The Kripkes had not been faculty at Cambridge.",
  "Not in their wildest dreams—they were anathema to English academia.",
  "Rather the Kripkes were visual artists and illusionists at Berkeley, where that sort of wild and unconventional magick was encouraged.",
  "Magnolia Kripke worked with oils and watercolors.",
  "Nicomachus Kripke did sleight-of-hand magick tricks.",
  "They were the rare academics who could fill both a Vegas auditorium and a lecture hall at Harvard.",
  "They could, with only black and white paint, create mazes inside a closet that made entrants feel as if they were walking around an entire courtyard.",
  "They could, with nothing but mirrors and light, convince their audience that they'd traveled back decades through time.",
  "",
  "Their commercial appeal led many in the academic establishment to discount their scholarship.",
  "It was, after all, a golden rule in academia that the more popular one was among the masses, the less valuable one's research had to be.",
  "Alice did not agree—in fact she had been something of a Magnolia Kripke fangirl during her undergraduate years, as were many young magicians of her age, and she felt that beneath the Kripkes' pomp and spectacle lay truly breathtaking theoretical advancements.",
  "But to most of their colleagues, the Kripkes were all smoke and mirrors; showmen only, not serious thinkers.",
  "The administration at Berkeley seemed to agree.",
  "The same year that the Kripkes sold out a headliner tour across North America, their tenure applications were denied.",
  "Insufficient contributions to the field.",
  "If only they'd spent less time partying in tour vans and more time publishing.",
  "",
  "Possibly this slight led the Kripkes to disappear from the public view for five years—it was rumored they took on private funding from millionaire dilettantes after they lost university affiliation—and then reappear for one dramatic exhibit at Royal Albert Hall.",
  "Their latest trick, the Kripkes announced, was to return from Hell.",
  "",
  "They distributed invitations all over the country in the weeks before this performance—cryptic, all-black papers with the words \"TO HELL AND BACK,\" with the subtitle, \"Professors Nicomachus and Magnolia Kripke.\"",
  "",
  "Only a smattering of academics showed up.",
  "The way Alice heard it, most people were put off by this ploy for attention.",
  "The Kripkes had invited three board members of the Royal Academy of magick, which was the number needed in attendance to verify the efficacy of any new magical technique, but those invitations were declined.",
  "Probably the Kripkes would put on some great, Gothic spectacle; lights, hellfire, maybe \"summon\" a demon or two.",
  "A pretty show, but not real magick.",
  "",
  "So no one expected it when, in front of a thousand people, Nicomachus and Magnolia Kripke carefully slit one another's carotid arteries, lay down, and bled to death on stage.",
  "",
  "Immediately the academic community distanced themselves from what had happened in London.",
  "That wasn't magick, that was all vulgar theatrics.",
  "The International Conference of Magick had a big role in that.",
  "They couldn't have the Kripkes' reputation bring down the rest of the field.",
  "They had come so far from the days they were maligned as a pseudoscience, as witchcraft, and all the pagan, Satanic spectacle of the Kripkes' work was very damaging to the field's legitimacy.",
  "",
  "Consensus was that the Kripkes had gone mad.",
  "The narrative was so convenient.",
  "Magick, especially of this variety, made one lose their grip on reality.",
  "The first rule every graduate student learned was that at the base of every paradox there existed the truth.",
  "That you should never fully believe your own lie, for then you lost power over the pentagram.",
  "That magick was an act of tricking the world but not yourself.",
  "You had to hold two opposing beliefs in your head at once.",
  "You had to know your way back.",
  "",
  "But Nicomachus and Magnolia had been living within increasingly complex webs of fantasy.",
  "It was inevitable—they had finally lost their grip on reality, had actually fooled themselves into thinking they had power over life and death.",
  "They were not magicians anymore.",
  "They were mere charlatans now, lost in their own illusions.",
  "",
  "So when the Kripkes died, the academic community greeted their disappearance with little ceremony.",
  "No one issued a retrospective of their work; no one edited a Festschrift; no one named any endowed chairs after them.",
  "The Kripkes' two graduate students dropped out of their respective programs.",
  "One found work as a visual effects designer in Hollywood, and the other was living in a commune outside Palo Alto the last anyone heard.",
  "",
  "Alice knew of the Kripkes, for she had fanatically researched everyone and everything tangentially related to underworld sojourns.",
  "She'd found a torn and bloodstained copy of their Royal Albert Hall pamphlet, crumpled carelessly at the bottom of a records box.",
  "She'd found what few research notes by Nicomachus and Magnolia were accessible to the public—the rest were lost when the Kripke family home was sold off.",
  "But small wonder Peter didn't recognize their names.",
  "After all, there wasn't much point studying someone who went to Hell and failed to come back.",

  "",
  "\"And what's your other theory?\"",
  "",
  "\"That they've split off parts of themselves into the bones. That the constructs are satellites of their own minds.\"",
  "",

  "Elspeth fidgeted with her chain.",

  "Sangat menawan, cara mereka memamerkan barang-barang yang mereka dapatkan dari toko amal, cara Belinda bersikeras agar mereka semua mengagumi teko susu porselennya yang sedikit terkelupas dengan cetakan anak kucing ketika mereka berkumpul di flatnya untuk minum teh.",
  "Tak satu pun dari mereka mampu membeli satu set peralatan makan yang serasi atau meja yang layak atau bahkan linen, tetapi mereka tetap bangga mengedarkan botol-botol anggur port murah yang mereka temukan di Sainsbury's karena merupakan kemewahan bisa minum anggur port.",
  "Suatu kali di tahun pertamanya Alice menemukan mangkuk saus perak asli di Oxfam, dan mereka semua duduk di lantainya dan makan saus jamur di bulan April.",

Tidak ada yang akan berhasil kembali dari Neraka sebelum pasangan Kripke, kau tahu. Tidak ada yang akan mengalahkan mereka. Mereka mencuri kapur mereka, mencuri catatan dan buku pelajaran mereka. Terkadang mereka menginterogasi mangsanya untuk perkembangan penelitian terbaru—aku pernah melihat jiwa-jiwa malang direntangkan di atas rak selama berhari-hari. Dan selalu, selalu, berakhir dengan menguras darah mereka. Mereka mengisi kantong kandung kemih mereka, mereka membasahi batang kapur mereka, dan mereka pergi.\"",

  "She checked her watch.",
  "Only three in the morning.",
  "She propped herself up on an elbow, wriggled over to him, and placed her lips beside his ear.",
  "“Murdoch.”",
  "",
  "He didn’t stir, so she dug her finger into his side and whispered again.",
  "“Murdoch.”",
  "",
  "He jerked away.",
  "“What?”",
  "",
  "“Shh.” Alice squinted into the stacks but saw nothing but waterlogged books.",
  "She supposed Elspeth was still upstairs.",
  "“The Dialetheia. Let’s find it.”",
  "",
  "Peter was fully awake now.",
  "“What are you talking about?”",
  "",
  "She kept her voice as low as she could.",
  "“Elspeth knows where it is. She thinks she’s close. We need to get it for ourselves.”",
  "",
  "She didn’t know where she stood now with Peter.",
  "He had ignored her pointedly throughout dinner, had spoken directly to Elspeth as if Alice weren’t present.",
  "",
  "But Alice had practice talking to angry men.",
  "She had honed this art after years of managing Professor Grimes, of learning to tiptoe on eggshells when he was in a foul mood.",
  "So many graduates had ended up on his permanent shit list for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.",
  "But Alice was like a finely tuned receiver, with an instinctive sense of when to talk him down, when to grovel, and when to stay out of his way.",
  "",
  "With angry sulking men, the secret was holding your ground.",
  "You didn’t get rebellious, no—that was asking for a slap to the face.",
  "But you didn’t self-flagellate, either.",
  "When you acted like you ought to be whipped, that only confirmed to them that you should.",
  "One should never cower.",
  "The secret rather was to keep talking as if you deserved no punishment at all, and then to distract them with something they wanted more than they wanted to hurt you.",
  "With Professor Grimes, it had always been upcoming conferences, exciting new papers.",
  "With Peter it would have to be their ticket out of Hell.",
  "She was fixing this.",
  "This was her apology.",
  "",
  "“She’s just saved our lives,” whispered Peter.",
  "",
  "“Which is proof she can take care of herself, isn’t it? Look. She’s nice and all, I feel rotten about it too. But she doesn’t know what it’s like to be alive anymore. She’s dressing in bones and skinning rats, for heaven’s sake. She’s hardly a person anymore. What’s she going to do back in Cambridge?”",
  "",
  "Peter was quiet for a moment.",

  "He’d come around.",
  "She knew he would, otherwise he wouldn’t have been talking to her.",

  "“It’s been ten years,” he admitted finally.",
  "",
  "“You see? There’s nothing for her up there, and the sooner she figures that out, the better. She really ought to just pass on. But, Murdoch!” Alice felt a thrum of excitement, the pleasure of resolve. Yes, she could be bold. Decisive. She was not falling apart; she could wrangle her mind into action. She had to take the lead now. This was how she made amends. “If we can get it first, then that’s all our problems, fixed—then we’ve only got to get to Lord Yama’s court and wait. We can bargain for Professor Grimes’s life, and our own exits besides.” She paused. “And then you wouldn’t have to exchange me, you know.”",
  "",
  "Peter did not react to this.",
  "For a long while all Alice could hear was his deep, even breathing.",
  "Then he murmured, “How?”",
  "",
  "“We’ll use magick.” Alice had thought this through.",
  "“Now we know all it takes is blood. We’ll use something to get her talking. I’ll distract her, and you encircle her in a pentagram, somehow. We’ll use the Liar Paradox.”",
  "",
  "Yes, it could be that simple.",
  "",
  "Consider the following sentence: This statement is false.",
  "",
  "It is devastatingly simple in its breaking of logic.",
  "You cannot believe it.",
  "You cannot disbelieve it.",
  "It has no truth value that you can settle on.",
  "You’re stuck in the middle, thrown on an endless loop from one end of the sentence to the next.",
  "",
  "The Liar Paradox was one of the oldest paradoxes of all time, for it violated that central premise of classical logic: the law of the excluded middle.",
  "Statements must either be true or false, and nothing in between.",
  "Still no one knew how to resolve the paradox.",
  "The Greeks and the Indians had been tooling around with the Liar Paradox for centuries; instead of resolving it, they merely came up with a whole family of related paradoxes, one of which involves Socrates, a crocodile, and a stolen child.",
  "It posed serious problems for the foundations of logic—indeed, Philitas of Cos agonized so much over the solution that he wasted away and died.",
  "",
  "Inscribed in a pentagram, the Liar Paradox could suspend truth and falsity entirely.",
  "Magicians did not use it often, for most of the time they needed someone to believe something, not to exist in a state of uncertainty.",
  "But Alice didn’t need Elspeth to believe anything in particular about them.",
  "She only needed Elspeth off her guard; willing to talk.",
  "And she already knew Elspeth liked to talk.",
  "The poor girl was desperate for anyone who would listen.",

  "Alice waited, hoping that he might say anything more.",
  "Wickedness felt better when you had a coconspirator; otherwise it was just you and your conscience.",

  "Tiny pupils, narrowed to slits.",

  "“I have a theory about why you’re so stuck on academia,” an old boyfriend of Alice’s had once told her, shortly before he became an ex.",
  "This was during their senior year of college, when she had been single-mindedly obsessed with graduate school applications to the point of neglect—and perhaps downright rudeness, as she had stood him up at least half a dozen times by now.",
  "This, paired with this boyfriend’s recent enrollment in a psychoanalysis seminar, made him vindictive.",
  "“You’re obsessed with gold stars. You never got over the high school thrill of an A+ at the top of your paper and academia will let you chase those little gold stars for the rest of your life.” He flicked her forehead. “Little ivory tower princess, you. You’re a teacher’s pet, Alice. You have a fetish for validation.”",
  "",
  "“Is that so?” Alice, whose mind was only on the prospect of fat envelopes from Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and Yale arriving in her mailbox, barely registered what he was saying.",

  "",
  "They broke up shortly after.",

  "“You’re giving up too much,” he had told her.",
  "“This can’t be worth it.”",
  "",
  "But of course it was worth it.",
  "It was the only thing that was worth it.",
  "She had been fortunate to find a vocation that made irrelevant everything else, and anything that made you forget to eat, drink, sleep, or maintain basic relationships—anything that made you so inhumanly excited—had to be pursued with single-minded devotion.",
  "",
    "Academia was decidedly not about the gold stars.",
  "If Alice had ever fallen prey to this notion, she was quickly disabused of it during her first year of coursework, wherein she heard every day a million things wrong with the way she thought, and only the occasional, “Not bad.”",
  "If you went into the field for gold stars you were in for disappointment.",
  "",
  "No, the point was the high of discovery.",
  "No one else understood—certainly not the ex, who went on to do something involving mortgages and making poor people poorer.",
  "How could she explain to him the way her mind felt as if it were chewing, digesting difficult concepts?",
  "That the headache she got after marking up an impenetrable text was like the pain in her gums after masticating on a good steak?",
  "The way her whole body thrummed in excitement when she came across the exact algorithm, translation, historical reproduction, she’d spent hours searching for in the library.",
  "The way she always forgot she needed rest as she hunched over a pentagram for hours, sometimes days, scribbling frantically away as idea after idea surged through her mind.",
  "",
  "How good it felt when she seemed to abandon her body altogether—when she became fully incorporeal, drifting happily in a universe of ideas.",
  "She was very proud of the days that she forgot to eat.",
  "Not because she had any revulsion for food, but because it was some proof that she had transcended some basic cycle of need.",
  "That she was not just an animal after all, held captive by her desires to eat and fuck and shit.",
  "That she was above all a mind, and the mind was capable of miraculous things.",
  "",
  "Sometimes she would jolt, and feel suddenly that she was standing still on a spinning plane while abstract shapes swirled about her, calling to her, revealing themselves in full.",
  "The mundane world faded away and she was alone in a field of black, except for the brilliant spots—revelations, directions, connections—dancing in the corners of her vision.",
  "Everything else was so insubstantial!",
  "The world of the college; of chairs screeching on classroom floors, spoons clicking in cups, umbrellas trembling under constant rain—it was just a front, she realized; only a flimsy glamour.",
  "Blink and it was gone.",
  "It was in the hidden world where truth resided and concepts begged to be understood.",
  "She only had to reach for them, and they would come to her.",
  "Yes.",
  "She only had to listen, and she would hear the music.",
  "",
  "In her freshman year, Alice had a professor whose lecturing style was defined by deep, spontaneous sighs.",
  "You could tell those weren’t preplanned sighs.",
  "Some professors sighed as a performance, obnoxiously, to inject profundity where really there was none, but no—this professor was simply so overwhelmed by the moment, by the tangled thoughts waiting to be undone and then articulated, that he would stare off into space and look deeply bothered and tap his fingers together until he figured out in what order to convey it all—and then his spindly shoulders would shake and he would rock back and forth, as if he were a mere vessel, and his body an imperfect tool to convey a message from the gods.",
  "Alice’s classmates found it funny.",
  "They would imitate Professor Eklund in the cafeteria, the way he sometimes lifted his entire knee onto the table as he rocked back and forth.",
  "What a dork, they said.",
  "What a poser, who does he think he is, who does he think he’s fooling?",
  "But Alice knew it was not a front.",
  "Professor Eklund was in that dark, spinning plane, hearing the music.",
  "She could see it in his eyes.",
  "She wanted to follow him there.",
  "",
  "No, prestige wasn’t the point.",
  "Elspeth was wrong.",
  "Elspeth had invested all her hopes in the wrong symbols.",
  "The symbolic order—the paper publications, the applause, the job postings, the grants—was not the point.",
  "Even the Oxbridge credentials, which Alice’s ex had assumed were solely what she was after, were not the point.",
  "Those were only instrumentally valuable to secure what Alice really wanted, which was unhampered time and access to the necessary resources to think.",
  "",
  "This was why she kept at it for years.",
  "This was why every graduate student she knew didn’t mind the low pay, the exhausting teaching assignments, or the nonexistent health care.",
  "They were all doing their best to extricate themselves from their bodies because they’d been told this was simply what they had to do.",
  "The whole system could be broken, and it wouldn’t matter.",
  "They’d put up with anything, only for the promise of access to that abstract plane.",
  "",
  "Peter understood.",
  "She’d seen the pure, serene bliss on his face as he stood at the blackboard, copying out equations so quickly she feared his wrist would cramp.",
  "That mode of concentration so deep you couldn’t snap him out of it if you tried, and nor would you want to.",
  "It was too lovely to watch a mind at ferocious work.",
  "",
  "Anyhow, it wasn’t just pretentious asceticism.",
  "There were the good nights, too.",
  "She remembered an end-of-term social her first year, when they’d all congregated at the local pizza shop and ordered a massive sourdough margherita to share.",
  "Even Peter had come that night, and everyone, Alice included, was too delighted by his presence to ask why he’d stood them up a dozen times throughout the semester.",
  "They’d started arguing about dialects and the reliability of regional studies, and from there moved on to debating what it meant to do close reading versus distance reading, and whether it made any sense to impose a third criterion called middle reading.",
  "",
  "Alice had never been so fond of her classmates until that night.",
  "It helped that the faculty were not present, and it helped that everyone was a little drunk, and no longer speaking to make the right impressions.",
  "They had the freedom to be wrong, which meant the freedom to get silly.",
  "And they got very silly.",
  "What was the difference between Kant’s noumena and Plato’s forms, they wondered.",
  "What was the precise definition of a sandwich, and was it still a sandwich if you ate it vertically?",
  "Was the horizontal definition sufficient to exclude tacos?",
  "Also, where were the aliens?",
  "From aliens they moved to Aristotle’s schema of cosmological physics—earth, water, air, the stars expanding outward from the center like shells, and above it all a celestial body—a “celestial space worm,” Michele called it, because it was more fun to think of this enormous, rotating, writhing being causing all the motion in the lower shells because it was thinking so hard about God, the unmoved first mover.",
  "",
  "At some point Peter and Michele started debating Michele’s rather dubious theory of personhood, which entailed that people died when they fell asleep, and woke up new versions of themselves that were related to, but were not quite, the person they’d been before.",
  "Consciousness can’t take breaks, Michele argued; when you fall asleep that’s it for you.",
  "",
  "“But what about dreams?” Peter asked.",
  "“Who is having the dreams?”",

  "“A half consciousness,” Michele insisted.",
  "“A soul neither living nor dead. An imprint. An eidolon.”",

  "Peter found this absurd, and Belinda found it romantic, and they all had a go at dissecting its implications before the conversation turned abruptly to the question of whether it was all right to have sex with trains, particularly if it violated Aristotle’s teaching that things should be used for their given functions (“Then what about people who use toothbrushes to masturbate?” Michele wanted to know, which made Belinda blush), and then under what particular circumstances one could, if one wanted, have sex with trains.",
  "For whatever reason this hit a vein, and their voices grew louder.",
  "At one point Belinda and Michele stood up, shouting over the table.",

  "Alice sat watching, cradling her beer, and she was so happy she could have cried.",

  "Here she belonged.",
  "Here she could utter things, could be honest about where her mind had drifted, and they wouldn’t look at her like she was mad.",
  "All her life she had bumbled through social contact like the only actor who’d forgotten to look at the script.",

  "It was the era of endless discovery.",
  "The physicians had made an artificial human heart.",
  "The astronomers were peering at the rings of Neptune; the geneticists were eradicating smallpox and stemming hepatitis B; the physicists were working out string theory; the geneticists were decoding human DNA.",
  "It seemed the whole world was spinning faster, growing more complex and exciting, and yet the field of magick seemed stuck in the mud, scholars driving themselves down increasingly tiny rabbit holes over minute disagreements rather than exploding the boundaries of what they could do.",

  "“But I find in our pentagrams something akin to music. Not in its total abstraction from everyday phenomena, but in its ability to pierce through to the center of them. That shining, cloudless plane of truth on which nothing else matters. It is as Heisenberg said, dear Alice. That modern physics has decided in favor of Plato, that the smallest units of matter are not physical objects in the ordinary sense, but forms, and ideas. And when you have complete mastery of these ideas, when you can hold them in your palm and twist and tease them at will—then you will have stepped closer to God. It will feel meticulous, yes. Petty, fleeting, pedantic. But all the more reason to double your drive, and clutch at every precious wisp of truth you glimpse.”",

  "Alice had located something in that cloud of symbols, a value that was not nonsense, and she believed in it with her entire being.",

Bidang kebenaran yang bersinar tanpa awan di mana tidak ada hal lain yang penting. Seperti kata Heisenberg, Alice tersayang. Bahwa fisika modern telah memutuskan mendukung Plato, bahwa unit materi terkecil bukanlah objek fisik dalam arti biasa, melainkan bentuk, dan ide. Dan ketika kau memiliki penguasaan penuh atas ide-ide ini, ketika kau bisa memegangnya di telapak tanganmu dan memutar serta menggodanya sesuka hati—maka kau akan melangkah lebih dekat kepada Tuhan. Ini akan terasa teliti, ya. Picik, sekilas, bertele-tele. Tetapi itulah alasan lebih kuat untuk melipatgandakan doronganmu, dan menggenggam setiap gumpalan kebenaran berharga yang kau lihat sekilas.”",

  "Alice gemetar saat membaca deskripsi ini—“Himne ini mereka kumur di kerongkongan / Karena mereka tak bisa mengucapkan kata dengan utuh”—karena itu adalah pertama kalinya seorang penyair tampaknya mengerti bahwa kemurkaan bukan sekadar eksternal; bukan hanya tornado kehancuran yang berteriak-teriak.",
  "Terkadang kau menelannya bulat-bulat seperti bara panas.",
  "Terkadang itu hanya membakarmu, perlahan, dari dalam ke luar, sampai kau tersedak.",
  "Dia memikirkan malam-malam yang dia habiskan terjaga, menelusuri sudut-sudut ingatan dan memicu dirinya sendiri menjadi murka—tetapi itu tidak pernah membuatnya membara, merasa benar; dia hanya mencekik dirinya sendiri dalam ketidakberdayaannya.",
  "Semua ini telah terjadi padaku, pikirnya, dan dunia ini tidak adil, dan tetap saja aku tidak bisa berbuat apa-apa.",
  "Lebih baik aku tenggelam saja.",
  "",
  "“Jadi apa yang ada di Wrath?” tanya Peter.",
  "“Lapangan rugbi?”",
  "",
  "“Sebenarnya tidak,” kata Elspeth.",
  "“Institusi terstruktur mulai hancur setelah Greed, kurasa.",
  "Lewat dari Wrath, semuanya jadi lebih menyerupai neraka klasik.",
  "Degenerasi jiwa, hilangnya akal sehat—semacam itulah.",
  "Kita melangkah sedikit lebih hati-hati di sini.”",
  "",
  "Alice menatap pantai mencari rawa jiwa bayangannya, seperti lalat buah yang tenggelam dalam sari apel.",
  "Namun di bawah cahaya pagi yang remang-remang, dia hanya melihat pantai gelap tanpa ujung.",
  "Pasirnya hitam pekat, meskipun dihiasi dengan titik-titik terang yang bercahaya.",
  "Jejak kaki, Alice menyadari; tak diragukan lagi bentuk tumit dan bola kaki.",
  "Meskipun makhluk yang menciptakannya pasti sangat besar, karena saat mereka makin dekat dia melihat jejak kaki itu setidaknya bisa merentang sepanjang tinggi tubuhnya.",
  "",
  "“Itu pasti ditinggalkan oleh Phlegyas,” kata Elspeth.",
  "“Seorang dewa.",
  "Dibuang ke dunia bawah karena membakar kuil Apollo setelah Apollo memerkosa putrinya.”",
  "",
  "“Itu tampaknya masuk akal,” kata Alice.",
  "“Maksudku pembakarannya, bukan pemerkosaannya.”",
  "",
  "“Yah, Phlegyas juga berpikir begitu.",
  "Selalu melolong tentang ketidakadilan.",
  "Lihat—itu dia, di kaki pegunungan itu.",
  "Bisakah kau melihatnya?”",
  "",
  "Alice menyipitkan mata ke arah dataran.",
  "Jauh di bawah tebing dia melihat cahaya merah tua yang berdenyut, bergerak berat melalui bebatuan.",
  "Dan di dalamnya, siluet gelap—tapi wujud apa itu, manusia atau binatang, dia tidak bisa membedakan.",
  "",
  "“Apakah dia berbahaya?”",
  "",
  "“Oh, sangat.",
  "Bisa membinasakanmu hanya dengan sekali pandang.",
  "Dia memang meninggalkan bara kecil yang indah ini ke mana pun dia melangkah.",
  "Bara yang tidak padam selama berminggu-minggu.",
  "Itulah yang kucari di sini.” Elspeth mengangguk ke arah lenteranya—yang, Alice perhatikan, menyala dengan warna merah tua berdenyut yang serupa.",
  "Sambil mendengus, dia menarik ember logam dari bawah tumpukan dayung.",
  "“Aku mau pergi mengumpulkan.",
  "Bisakah kalian berdua menjaga perahu?”",
  "",
  "“Oh—tentu.” Alice menjadi bersemangat.",
  "Dia telah memutar otak tentang bagaimana menjebak Elspeth di bawah pengawasannya, dan di sini kesempatan itu baru saja jatuh ke pangkuan mereka.",
  "“Apa yang harus kami—”",
  "",
  "“Tetap saja di dekat jangkar.” Elspeth sudah memanjat ke atas pagar.",
  "“Dan jika makhluk-makhluk tulang itu mendekat, semprot saja mereka.",
  "Aku benci kalau mereka naik ke kapal.”",
  "",
  "Satu lompatan anggun, dan dia sudah di pantai.",
  "Alice melihatnya menari dengan lincah di atas bara, melompat dari batu ke batu sampai dia menghilang dari pandangan.",
  "",
  "Dia merasakan sesuatu di punggungnya.",
  "Dia berbalik, lalu tersentak.",
  "Peter berdiri sangat dekat di belakangnya, mata terpaku ke depan pada Elspeth.",
  "",
  "“Sekarang waktunya,” gumamnya.",
  "“Kau mau mengalihkan perhatiannya?",
  "Atau menggambar pentagram?”",
  "",
  "Itu adalah kata-kata pertama yang dia ucapkan padanya sepanjang pagi.",
  "Dia mencoba menyembunyikan kelegaannya.",
  "“Um—yang mana saja, kurasa.",
  "Apa yang kau—”",
  "",
  "“Aku lebih cepat dengan pentagram.",
  "Aku yang akan menggambarnya.”",
  "",
  "Alice tidak yakin ini benar tapi merasa sekarang bukan waktunya untuk membantah.",
  "“Baiklah.",
  "Di mana sebaiknya—maksudku, di mana menurutmu kita bisa menangkapnya?”",
  "",
  "Dia telah bergulat dengan ini sepanjang pagi.",
  "Memeras informasi dari Elspeth adalah satu hal; yang lebih sulit adalah memasukkannya ke dalam pentagram.",
  "Masalah dengan pentagram yang dibasahi darah adalah sangat sulit untuk disembunyikan.",
  "Secara teoritis ukuran pentagram tidak memengaruhi potensinya—dan memang, dalam sejarah Romawi bangsa Kelt telah menggambar struktur kapur besar di sekitar seluruh bukit dan hutan untuk menjebak musuh mereka.",
  "Tetapi itu akan memakan waktu, dan lebih banyak darah daripada yang mereka miliki.",
  "",
  "“Tangkap saja dia di dekat kompor,” kata Peter.",
  "“Ada keset—kita bisa menggambarnya sekarang, menyiapkannya di sana sebelum dia kembali.",
  "Kau pikir ada waktu?”",
  "",
  "Alice melirik kembali ke pantai, di mana Elspeth sedang menyekop bara ke dalam embernya dengan penuh semangat.",
  "“Kau harus cepat.”",
  "",
  "“Tentu.",
  "Bisa minta pisau?”",
  "",
  "“Kenapa—oh.” Dia memancingnya keluar dari ranselnya.",
  "“Ini—hati-hati.”",
  "",
  "“Aku akan berusaha sebaik mungkin,” gumam Peter, dan menuju tangga.",
  "",
  "Alice menarik napas gemetar dan berbalik kembali ke pantai.",
  "Ember Elspeth hampir penuh.",
  "Dia melihat Alice menatapnya, menegakkan tubuh, dan melambai dengan riang.",
  "Alice melambai balik, merasa busuk.",
  "",
  "Miliki tekad, pikirnya.",
  "Profesor Grimes telah mengajarkan ini padanya.",
  "Perbedaan antara kehebatan dan biasa-biasa saja hanyalah tentang menuntaskan apa yang dimulai.",
  "Bagaimanapun, ini adalah hal yang baik, hal yang penuh belas kasih.",
  "Elspeth harus dibebaskan dari penderitaannya.",
  "Satu percakapan—hanya itu yang dibutuhkan.",
  "Dan kemudian mereka akan melanjutkan perjalanan, dan Elspeth hanya akan menjadi kenangan yang canggung.",
  "",
  "“Halo!",
  "Ambil ini.” Berdiri jinjit di pantai, Elspeth mengayunkan ember bara ke depan menggunakan ujung tombaknya.",
  "Alice menangkapnya dan menariknya ke tengah geladak.",
  "Dari sudut matanya dia melihat Peter menghilang ke arah tangga, lengannya didekapkan ke sisi tubuh.",
  "",
  "Dia menegakkan tubuh.",
  "“Hei, Elspeth?”",
  "",
  "“Ya, sayang.”",
  "",
  "“Katakan kalau ini lancang, tapi aku bertanya-tanya apakah kita bisa—maksudku, aku ingin sekali minum teh.” Dia berdeham.",
  "“Kalau kau punya.",
  "Sudah lama sekali.”",
  "",
  "“Penyihir.” Elspeth terkekeh.",
  "“Tak tertolong.",
  "Apa Earl Grey tidak masalah?",
  "Hanya itu yang kupunya.”",
  "",
  "“Earl Grey terdengar sempurna.”",
  "",
  "“Ayo, aku tunjukkan cara kerja kompornya.",
  "Ambil penjepit itu, batu baranya habis—” Elspeth memberi isyarat, dan Alice dengan hati-hati mengambil bara yang menyala dari ember.",
  "",
  "Elspeth berjongkok di depan kompor.",
  "Keset itu tergeletak kokoh di tempat Peter meninggalkannya.",
  "Itu benda kotor berwarna cokelat kehitaman yang mungkin dulunya kuning, serat sintetis yang tergenang air dan penuh pasir.",
  "Di bawah kaki kompor Alice melihat tulisan sambung pudar yang berbunyi: Rumah adalah di mana hati berada.",
  "Dia bisa membayangkan Elspeth menemukannya saat memulung, dan membawanya kembali dengan gembira ke kapalnya.",
  "Halo, tulang-tulangku yang cantik!",
  "Lihat apa yang kutemukan.",
  "",
  "“Di sini.” Elspeth melambaikan tangan agar Alice meletakkan bara di tengah, lalu mengambil teko teh yang bernoda dan retak dari laci pengembang roti.",
  "Ini dia isi dengan botol salinan Alice.",
  "Tetesan air mengalir keluar dari retakan, mendesis dengan nyaman di kompor.",
  "Bersama-sama mereka berdiri di atas api, menyaksikan uap mengepul dari sisi teko.",
  "Archimedes muncul entah dari mana dan bertengger di dekat kaki Elspeth di dekat kompor, berjemur dalam cahaya hangat.",
  "",
  "“Di mana Peter?” tanya Elspeth.",
  "",
  "“Oh—um, mau berbaring, kurasa.” Alice bertanya-tanya apakah Peter punya waktu untuk mengaktifkan pentagram itu.",
  "Dia tidak mendengar Peter berbicara di geladak—tetapi pentagram bisa diaktifkan dari jarak jauh, terutama jika dia berdiri di bawahnya sekarang.",
  "Dia mengulur waktu.",
  "“Kurasa dia lelah.”",
  "",
  "“Dia tipe perenung, ya?”",
  "",
  "“Bisa dibilang begitu, ya.” Alice memilin jempolnya, mencari-cari dengan panik bagaimana harus melanjutkan.",
  "",
  "Dia tidak pernah pandai berbohong.",
  "Pernah Profesor Grimes mengirimnya ke kantor Profesor Stuart untuk mencari tahu apakah dia mengejar jenis himpunan bagian Curry yang sama dengan yang ingin dikerjakan Profesor Grimes, dan dia mengacaukan segalanya begitu parah sehingga sepuluh menit kemudian, Profesor Stuart mulai mengingatkannya dengan canggung tapi ramah bahwa dia punya istri dan anak.",
  "Tapi semua akademisi, dia tahu, senang ditanya tentang penelitian mereka.",
  "Dan tidak sulit membuat Elspeth bicara—lagipula, dia sudah menderita begitu lama tanpa ada yang mendengarkan.",
  "",
  "“Jadi siapa yang ada di Wrath, omong-omong?” Dia mengerahkan nada paling santai yang dia bisa.",
  "“Manajer lab dan panitera?”",
  "",
  "“Tidak ada yang bagus.",
  "Aku tidak melihat banyak orang melewati Wrath, sejujurnya.",
  "Dan yang lewat, aku lebih sering mendengar daripada melihat mereka.” Elspeth menggelengkan kepala.",
  "“Tempat yang mengerikan.",
  "Aku tidak pernah pergi jauh dari pantai.”",
  "",
  "“Apakah kau mengerti tujuan pengadilan-pengadilan itu?” desak Alice.",
  "“Kami sendiri bingung.",
  "Tampaknya—tampaknya, pada akhirnya, hukuman itu sepenuhnya acak.”",
  "",
  "“Apanya yang acak?”",
  "",
  "“Yah, aku tidak bisa tahu apa poin dari semua ini,” kata Alice.",
  "“Pride dan Desire, mungkin.",
  "Kau mengatasi egomu lalu kau keluar.",
  "Tapi Greed?",
  "Apa yang mereka lakukan di sana?",
  "Untuk apa semua itu?”",
  "",
  "“Mana kutahu.",
  "Kau berhenti bertanya, setelah beberapa saat.”",
  "",
  "“Tapi ini sangat menjengkelkan,” kata Alice.",
  "“Semua sarjana ini punya teori-teori ini—tentang dosa, karma, pertobatan—dan kemudian kau datang ke Neraka dan menyadari semuanya terserah pada keinginan para dewa.",
  "Dan aku hanya berpikir jika ada Tartarolog yang benar-benar datang ke sini, mereka akan membakar publikasi mereka sebelumnya.”",
  "",
  "“Itu karena mereka ingin memperlakukan Akhirat seperti permainan,” kata Elspeth.",
  "“Semua akademisi itu memaksakan fenomena alam masuk ke dalam kotak yang tidak muat.",
  "Mereka ingin memprogramnya karena itu membuat mereka merasa aman, karena jika mereka bisa menunjuk semua pendosa di Greed dan Wrath dan Tyranny dan berkata Yah setidaknya aku tidak seburuk dia, maka mereka tidak perlu terlalu khawatir.",
  "Dan mereka frustrasi ketika Neraka tidak mau mengikuti aturan main itu.”",
  "",
  "“Tapi seharusnya ada keteraturan,” kata Alice.",
  "“Seharusnya adil.”",
  "",
  "“Kau ingin Neraka mematuhi aturan logika klasik.”",
  "",
  "“Bukan logika, harusnya,” kata Alice.",
  "“Aku tahu ada elemen ilahi, dan semua itu.",
  "Tapi kosmos seharusnya memiliki koherensi, tidakkah menurutmu begitu?”",
  "",
  "“Kau benar-benar anggota Mazhab Cambridge yang tak tertolong,” kata Elspeth.",
  "“Semuanya pembangun sistem.",
  "Sirkuit tertutup.",
  "Bah.",
  "Tidak pernah terbuka pada spontanitas.”",
  "",
  "“Aku hanya suka mengetahui apa yang menanti,” kata Alice.",
  "“Itu saja.”",
  "",
  "“Ini, mungkin ini bisa membuatmu merasa lebih baik.",
  "Kau mau dengar teoriku?”",
  "",
  "“Oh, ya.”",
  "",
  "“Yah, menurutku kesalahpahaman terbesar tentang Buddhisme adalah bahwa karma berfungsi sebagai perhitungan besar yang kau hitung di penghujung hari.” Elspeth melambaikan tangan.",
  "“Tapi tidak seperti kau mendapat lima ratus poin baik dan delapan ratus poin buruk, sehingga di Neraka kau harus mempertanggungjawabkan defisit bersih tiga ratus.",
  "Sama sekali tidak serapi itu.",
  "Karma lebih seperti—hm.",
  "Bisa dibilang karma itu seperti benih.",
  "Benih tumbuh menjadi buah.",
  "Karma adalah konsekuensi alami.",
  "Keburukan menumpuk.",
  "Itu memengaruhi cara kau menjalani hidup, cara kau memandang dunia.",
  "Ketika kau melakukan hal-hal jahat, kau melihat dunia sebagai tempat yang picik dan egois dan kejam.",
  "Dan apa yang kau alami di Neraka hanyalah efek riak terakhir dari kejahatan awalmu.",
  "Kau mendapatkan tepat apa yang kau minta.",
  "Dan kupikir seluruh poin Neraka adalah untuk menunjukkan padamu sejauh mana keinginanmu itu.”",
  "",
  "“Huh.” Alice memikirkan ini dalam benaknya.",
  "Teori ini menarik, pikirnya, tapi masih banyak hal yang tidak bisa dijelaskannya.",
  "“Dan Arwah di Greed—itu yang mereka inginkan selama ini?",
  "Membuat tombak di pantai?”",
  "",
  "“Yang mereka inginkan adalah menjadi lebih baik dari orang lain,” kata Elspeth.",
  "“Dan sekarang mereka punya kesempatan untuk membuktikannya.",
  "Mereka bisa bergulat di lumpur.",
  "Membuktikan kekuatan mereka dan menaklukkan pikiran yang lebih lemah.",
  "Setiap hari.",
  "Mereka mungkin berada di surga.",
  "Intinya adalah, Neraka tidak begitu buruk bagi orang-orang yang ada di dalamnya.",
  "Mereka berada tepat di tempat yang mereka inginkan.”",

  "Teko mulai bersiul.",
  "Elspeth mengangkatnya dari kompor, menuangkan air dengan hati-hati ke dalam dua cangkir teh, dan menyerahkan satu kepada Alice.",
  "“Ini dia.”",
  "",
  "“Trims.” Alice menundukkan kepala untuk menyesap, tapi bau busuk menusuk hidungnya.",
  "Dia berkedip ke bawah; butiran hitam tebal mengapung di permukaan air.",
  "Ini jelas bukan Earl Grey.",
  "Elspeth sedang mengamatinya, jadi dia memasang senyum meringis dan pura-pura menyesap.",
  "",
  "“Gula?” tanya Elspeth.",
  "",
  "“Boleh juga.”",
  "",
  "Elspeth menjangkau ke belakang kompor dan menjatuhkan sesuatu yang kecil ke dalam cangkir Alice.",
  "Alice mengaduk, dan pura-pura tidak menyadari bahwa itu adalah kerikil.",

  "“Maaf,” kata Alice.",
  "“Kurasa itu kasar.”",

  "“Sangat,” kata Elspeth.",
  "",
  "“Aku hanya berpikir, kadang-kadang, alangkah indahnya jika bisa berlalu begitu saja dan memulai lagi.” Alice pura-pura menyesap tehnya lagi.",
  "“Maksudku, jika kau tidak melakukan sesuatu yang mengerikan, kau mungkin lebih baik menelannya dan melanjutkan hidup, tidakkah menurutmu begitu?”",
  "",
  "Mata Elspeth menyipit.",
  "“Kalian berdua tampaknya sangat bersemangat membujukku untuk menyerah dan mati.”",

  "“Tidak, tidak, aku hanya—aku mencoba mengerti.” Mulut Alice terasa kering.",
  "Dia menelan ludah, yang tidak membantu.",
  "“Tampaknya aneh terus mengejar sesuatu yang tidak ada, padahal kau bisa saja—maksudku, padahal akan sangat mudah untuk melanjutkan saja.”",
  "",
  "“Aku menyangkal premisnya, tapi tentu.” Elspeth bersandar di kompor.",
  "“Ada yang salah dengan tehnya?”",
  "",
  "“Tidak, tidak, ini enak—um.” Alice melengkungkan jari-jarinya di sekitar cangkir.",
  "Dia merasa pusing.",
  "Oh, dia sangat payah dalam hal ini.",

  "Ekspresi aneh muncul di wajah Elspeth.",
  "",
  "Apakah ini pentagram yang bekerja?",
  "Alice tidak bisa memastikan.",
  "Dia belum pernah bermain-main dengan Paradoks Pembohong sejak tahun pertamanya, dan tidak bisa mengingat dengan tajam apa yang dilakukannya pada korbannya.",

  "Apakah dia linglung?",

  "Keheningan yang menyiksa.",
  "Alice sempat berpikir untuk lari, atau melawan—tapi ke mana?",
  "Dan dengan apa?",
  "Dia hanya bisa mencengkeram cangkir tehnya dan berdiri di sana seperti orang bodoh.",

  "",
  "“Sebelah sana,” bentak Elspeth.",
  "Peter menurut, dan mengambil tempat di sebelah Alice.",
  "Berdampingan mereka seperti anak-anak yang dimarahi, menunggu hukuman.",
  "Archimedes bertengger di atas kompor di samping Elspeth, memelototi dengan sok suci melalui pupil yang mengecil.",

  "Alice dan Peter mundur tergesa-gesa, tapi Elspeth mendekat, kupu-kupu berlipat ganda setiap langkah, sampai dia bukan lagi manusia melainkan gumpalan beludru yang berdesir, gelap dan penuh celaan.",

  "Aku mahasiswa Grimes, mungkin kau ingat.” Dia menendang keset itu menjauh dan mulai menggoreskan perubahan pada karya Peter.",
  "Dia menulis dengan kecepatan luar biasa, bergumam dalam bahasa Yunani sembari melakukannya.",
  "Ini sihir yang sangat mengesankan—sangat sedikit penyihir yang bisa menulis rajah dan merapal mantra secara bersamaan.",
  "Dia hebat, pikir Alice; dia layak menjadi murid Grimes.",
  "“Kau pikir aku sudah berada di bawah sini selama beberapa dekade, berdansa dengan para Kripke, dan aku tidak tahu jalan di sekitar Paradoks Pembohong sialan ini?” Dia menutup lingkaran itu dengan goresan terakhir yang ganas.",

  "That the academy was sexist was such a boring truism that Alice was no longer disturbed by the fact.",
  "When in 1893 the Cambridge University Senate proposed granting full degrees to women, protesting students hung an effigy of a female cyclist at the end of King’s Parade.",
  "When the proposal was dropped, the protestors decapitated and tore the effigy apart in celebration.",
  "It took nearly another century for all the Oxbridge colleges to admit female students.",
  "Magdalene was the last, and only began admitting women the year Alice arrived.",
  "On the first day of term, the male students wore black armbands, and the flag was flown at half-mast.",
  "",
  "Still, there was a general consensus among the women of Alice’s cohort that feminism was an embarrassing fad, a bygone fever of the seventies.",
  "Alice certainly wanted nothing to do with it.",
  "She was not interested in reading Kristeva or Irigaray, in comparing everything to a phallus, in altering language to take the “his” out of “history.”",
  "She couldn’t stand those screeching activists who believed the only politically just thing was to become a lesbian.",
  "Burning bras, trashing dolls, the constant invocation of that scary word discrimination—it was all so embarrassing, it felt less like a revolution than a tantrum.",
  "It seemed the best way to prove women were not inferior was just to not be inferior.",

  "In college, Alice had shared several classes with a girl named Lacey Cudworth, who regularly burst into tears when she felt her classmates argued in a very “male” way with her or insinuated that women were not good logicians.",
  "Occasionally Lacey turned to Alice for solidarity, and Alice rebuffed these overtures.",
  "Do not come to me, she thought; we are not alike.",
  "She thought Lacey gave women a bad name; that her complaints justified everything men believed about women, and that Lacey was focusing her energies on the wrong issues besides.",
  "Of course their departments were run by stodgy old men with wandering eyes who thought they were good for little more than producing babies.",
  "Those men would be dead and buried soon enough—meanwhile, wasn’t the work fun!",

  "But Alice was not prepared for how astonishingly, indeed comically, bad it could be.",
  "In her undergraduate days she’d been shielded from the worst of it by a kind advisor and the fact that, as an undergraduate, she was too insignificant for the big bad wolves to care about.",
  "So she was shocked when she arrived at Cambridge to discover that yes, indeed, tenured professors could ask her in company when she intended to get pregnant (hopefully not during her PhD, but ideally before she turned thirty and her womb shriveled); whether she’d started dating in another department yet (this would increase her chances of getting a spousal hire in case she herself could not find a job), and whether she would consider coming to work in a shorter skirt (this would raise morale among the male postgraduates).",

  "It was enough to drive anyone to quit.",
  "Certainly it turned most of the women at Cambridge bitter.",
  "The beautiful Belinda, so keenly aware of her charms, quickly traded her silk blouses for men’s oxford shirts; though this did not work, and the boys began calling her Axiothea in jest.",
  "Katie, a junior faculty member whom Alice sometimes met for coffee, kept her hair shorn close to her scalp, though this backfired as rumors circulated she was a lesbian.",
  "Ada and Geraldine simply left the department—and the field, for all Alice knew—the moment they were married and never returned.",
  "",
  "Alice, however, was still convinced by the impossible mean—the idea that there might exist some perfect line between femininity and subjugation, wherein if she could only wear clothes that were both perfectly attractive and perfectly modest, she could both enjoy the attention that being a woman in the department got her while also commanding respect as a scholar.",
  "The chances this mean existed were vanishingly small, but still Alice clung to this hope.",
  "The whole endeavor of graduate study was clinging to vanishingly small hopes.",

  "And she went home and held her hair up in a bun at the back of her head, and wondered if she passed muster.",
  "",
  "It was her fault because at night, sometimes, she fantasized about his hands on her shoulders, his eyes locked on hers.",

  "She noticed Charlotte glowering at the other women in the department, Belinda in particular; eyes narrowed, fingers twisting.",
  "She wondered sometimes when she gazed into Charlotte’s shadowed, haggard face if Charlotte might confide in her—but all she ever got in return was a polite, “Morning, Alice.”",

  "",
  "It happened the night they returned from the Leverhulme Prize dinner; dizzy, elated, both of them drunk on the attention they’d received all evening.",
  "They took the late train back from Liverpool Street station, and then a cab back to the department—the department, not their respective lodgings, because Professor Grimes had decided at the station that they first must stop by his office to pick up some papers and Alice, thrilled and exhausted, didn’t think to interrogate this threadbare excuse.",
  "",
  "At the department they kept giggling, bumping into things.",
  "Professor Grimes lost his balance and smeared his hand through a set of algorithms Michele had been laboring through on the blackboard all week, a perfect five-fingered arc through the dense layers of chalk, and this struck them both as tremendously funny.",

  "What shamed her most about that night, the memory she could never drive out of her skull, was how close she’d come to saying yes to it all.",
  "",
  "It would have made everything so easy, if she’d just given Professor Grimes what he wanted.",
  "He’d have satisfied his urges.",
  "He’d have been sated, happy with her, and that might have given her some reprieve.",
  "In the tired moments after she might have asked for some guidance on her research proposal.",
  "She might have asked him to put in a good word for her when she applied for extra funding that summer.",
  "She might even have gotten some pleasure out of it.",
  "She was sure that, if she split her mind in two, if she ignored all the parts of her that were screaming, if she sank back into her tipsy stupid buzz, then she could turn it into a fun night that got a bit wild.",
  "",
  "And it might continue, because if you said yes once it meant you said yes to all times in the future.",
  "But then she only had three years to go.",
  "In three years, she would graduate, collect her recommendation letters, and move on to some new institution where her work would be so dazzling that soon everyone would ignore the rumors that floated around her.",

  "“Please.”",
  "At last she found the strength to break from his grip.",

  "After that night Professor Grimes turned so cold.",

  "She saw it coming, yet she was gutted by the sudden withdrawal of his support.",

  "There was no sign of when it might end.",
  "She didn’t know when he would retaliate, if he was planning some further punishment.",
  "She didn’t know whether she even crossed his mind at all—whether he’d simply written her wholesale out of his field of thought.",
  "She could only tiptoe around his office, hold her breath when he was near, and, day in and day out, hope for his mercy.",
  "",
  "She did have reason to keep showing up at the department.",
  "She had projects in place, papers to write, classes to teach.",
  "He couldn’t just invalidate her work.",
  "She was good at what she did, and had proven her mettle to the other faculty many times over by now.",
  "And he couldn’t continue ignoring her in front of everyone else.",
  "In public, at least, he had to keep up the pretense of a good advisor.",
  "He wanted to invite questions even less than she did.",

  "Little blows.",
  "He no longer welcomed her in his office for tea.",
  "When he was announced editor of the latest collected volume on linguistic magick he did not ask her to contribute, though she would have been the obvious choice to write the introductory chapter on false friends and cognates that he instead assigned to a first-year who could barely spell his own name.",

  "Not only a kiss, thought Alice.",

  "She liked to imagine her bones crunching; her blood splattering across the pavement.",
  "She made a game of wondering what, precisely, would be the acute cause of death—the splintering of her skull into her brain?",
  "That would be best—much worse was the messy, internal splitting that irrevocably broke you but left intact your ability to feel pain, your ability to think and reflect that this was the end.",

  "Bahwa dunia akademis itu seksis adalah kebenaran klise yang begitu membosankan sampai-sampai Alice tak lagi terganggu oleh faktanya.",
  "Ketika Senat Universitas Cambridge mengusulkan pemberian gelar penuh kepada perempuan pada tahun 1893, para mahasiswa yang protes menggantung boneka pesepeda perempuan di ujung King’s Parade.",
  "Ketika usulan itu dibatalkan, para demonstran memenggal dan mencabik-cabik boneka itu sebagai perayaan.",
  "Butuh waktu hampir satu abad lagi bagi seluruh perguruan tinggi Oxbridge untuk menerima mahasiswa perempuan.",
  "Magdalene adalah yang terakhir, dan baru mulai menerima perempuan pada tahun Alice tiba.",
  "Pada hari pertama semester, para mahasiswa laki-laki mengenakan ban lengan hitam, dan bendera dikibarkan setengah tiang.",
  "",
  "Meski begitu, ada konsensus umum di antara para perempuan di angkatan Alice bahwa feminisme adalah tren memalukan, demam masa lalu dari tahun tujuh puluhan.",
  "Alice jelas tak ingin berurusan dengan hal itu.",
  "Dia tak tertarik membaca Kristeva atau Irigaray, membandingkan segala sesuatu dengan falus, atau mengubah bahasa untuk membuang kata “his” dari “history.”",
  "Dia tak tahan dengan para aktivis memekik yang percaya bahwa satu-satunya tindakan politik yang adil adalah menjadi lesbian.",
  "Membakar bra, merusak boneka, penyebutan terus-menerus kata menakutkan diskriminasi itu—semuanya begitu memalukan, rasanya kurang seperti revolusi dan lebih seperti amukan manja.",
  "Tampaknya cara terbaik untuk membuktikan perempuan tidak inferior adalah dengan tidak menjadi inferior.",
  "",
  "Seberapa susah hal itu dilakukan?",
  "",
  "Saat kuliah, Alice pernah sekelas dengan gadis bernama Lacey Cudworth, yang sering kali meledak tangisnya ketika merasa teman-teman sekelasnya berdebat dengan cara yang sangat “laki-laki” dengannya atau menyindir bahwa perempuan bukanlah ahli logika yang baik.",
  "Sesekali Lacey berpaling pada Alice demi solidaritas, dan Alice menampik pendekatan ini.",
  "Jangan datang padaku, pikirnya; kita tidak sama.",
  "Dia pikir Lacey mencoreng nama baik perempuan; bahwa keluhannya membenarkan segala yang diyakini laki-laki tentang perempuan, dan lagipula Lacey memfokuskan energinya pada masalah yang salah.",
  "Tentu saja departemen mereka dijalankan oleh laki-laki tua kaku bermata keranjang yang mengira perempuan tak lebih dari sekadar pabrik bayi.",
  "Laki-laki itu akan segera mati dan dikubur—sementara itu, bukankah pekerjaannya menyenangkan!",
  "",
  "Namun Alice tidak siap menghadapi betapa buruknya situasi itu, sungguh buruk hingga menggelikan.",
  "Di masa sarjananya, dia terlindungi dari hal-hal terburuk berkat pembimbing yang baik dan fakta bahwa, sebagai mahasiswa S1, dia terlalu tidak penting untuk dipedulikan oleh serigala-serigala jahat itu.",
  "Jadi dia terkejut ketika tiba di Cambridge dan mendapati bahwa ya, memang benar, profesor tetap bisa bertanya di depan umum kapan dia berniat hamil (semoga tidak selama PhD, tapi idealnya sebelum dia berusia tiga puluh dan rahimnya mengerut); apakah dia sudah mulai berkencan dengan orang departemen lain (ini akan meningkatkan peluangnya mendapatkan 'rekrutan pasangan' jika dia sendiri tidak bisa mendapatkan pekerjaan), dan apakah dia mau mempertimbangkan datang bekerja dengan rok yang lebih pendek (ini akan meningkatkan semangat di kalangan pascasarjana laki-laki).",
  "",
  "Itu cukup untuk membuat siapa pun ingin berhenti.",
  "Tentu saja hal itu membuat sebagian besar perempuan di Cambridge menjadi pahit.",
  "Belinda yang cantik, yang begitu sadar akan pesonanya, dengan cepat menukar blus sutranya dengan kemeja oxford pria; meskipun ini tidak berhasil, dan para lelaki mulai memanggilnya Axiothea sebagai lelucon.",
  "Katie, anggota fakultas junior yang kadang ditemui Alice untuk minum kopi, memangkas rambutnya hingga cepak, meskipun ini menjadi bumerang karena rumor beredar bahwa dia lesbian.",
  "Ada dan Geraldine begitu saja meninggalkan departemen—dan bidang itu, setahu Alice—saat mereka menikah dan tidak pernah kembali.",
  "",
  "Alice, bagaimanapun, masih yakin dengan jalan tengah yang mustahil—gagasan bahwa mungkin ada garis sempurna antara feminitas dan penaklukan, di mana jika dia bisa mengenakan pakaian yang menarik sekaligus sopan, dia bisa menikmati perhatian sebagai perempuan di departemen sambil tetap mendapatkan rasa hormat sebagai cendekiawan.",
  "Peluang adanya jalan tengah ini sangat kecil, tapi Alice tetap berpegang pada harapan ini.",
  "Seluruh usaha studi pascasarjana adalah berpegang pada harapan yang sangat kecil.",
  "Menjadi penyihir berarti menjadi kura-kura yang balapan dengan Achilles; menipu dirinya sendiri, saat si pelari membayangi semakin besar di belakangnya, bahwa ruang dan waktu akan berhenti sehingga dia bisa tetap di depan.",
  "",
  "Jika ada yang bertanya pada Alice mengapa dia tidak pernah melaporkan Profesor Grimes atas apa pun yang pernah pria itu katakan atau lakukan padanya, dia akan menjelaskan bahwa tidak ada yang perlu dilaporkan, karena itu salahnya.",
  "",
  "Itu salahnya, tahu, karena ketika dia pertama kali mendengar bahwa Profesor Grimes punya masalah menjaga tangannya di sekitar mahasiswa perempuan, dia merasakan getaran kegembiraan.",
  "Oh tentu—dia menyatakan kejijikan di depan umum, lalu secara pribadi bertanya-tanya apakah dia cukup cantik, cukup halus dan kurus, untuk menarik perhatian yang sama.",
  "Dia suka gadis yang terlihat seperti balerina, kata mereka; makhluk sedih dan kurus kering yang punya masalah dengan figur ayah.",
  "Dan dia pulang ke rumah, menggelung rambutnya di belakang kepala, dan bertanya-tanya apakah dia memenuhi standar.",
  "",
  "Itu salahnya karena di malam hari, terkadang, dia berfantasi tentang tangan pria itu di bahunya, matanya terkunci pada matanya.",
  "Fantasi-fantasi ini tidak pernah mengarah ke hal-hal badaniah—secara teori, itu sesuatu yang dia inginkan; tapi rasanya salah, entah bagaimana, untuk mencemari keagungan Profesor Grimes, mereduksinya menjadi tubuh yang berkeringat dan penuh nafsu.",
  "Dia tidak bisa menyamakan Profesor Grimes dengan anak-anak lelaki kampus yang terengah-engah dan putus asa itu, yang berubah menjadi binatang tanpa pikiran begitu tangannya melayang ke arah selangkangan mereka.",
  "Yang dia cintai dari Profesor Grimes adalah pikirannya.",
  "Kecerdasan setajam pisau itu.",

  "Betapa dia suka menjadi favoritnya—Alice sudah melakukannya, kalian semua harus lebih seperti Alice.",
  "",
  "Dia tahu pria itu menganggapnya menarik.",
  "Dia telah memperhatikan terlalu banyak tatapan yang tertahan, terlalu banyak tangan di bahunya yang bertahan jauh lebih lama dari yang seharusnya, untuk tetap ragu apakah profesornya akan menidurinya jika diberi kesempatan.",
  "Pengetahuan ini memberinya rasa kekuasaan yang menyimpang, selama dia tidak menindaklanjutinya.",
  "Karena dia bisa, dia bisa saja; yang harus dia lakukan hanyalah bilang ya.",
  "Dia tahu mungkin inilah alasan pria itu memilihnya sebagai bimbingan; alasan pria itu membawanya ke konferensi dan perjalanan penelitian.",
  "Dia tahu apa yang mereka katakan tentang Profesor Grimes di balik pintu tertutup, dan kadang-kadang di depan wajahnya.",

  "Yah, jika itu hanya lengannya, tak masalah.",
  "Pilih kasih itu tak masalah selama menguntungkannya.",

  "Gadis yang menjadi segalanya sekaligus.",
  "Itu adalah hari-hari memudarnya gelombang kedua feminisme, dan semua gadis di generasi Alice begitu lelah diberi tahu bahwa mereka dilahirkan untuk diperkosa, ditindas, dibungkam.",
  "Pastinya ini bukan gambaran keseluruhannya; pastinya ada kekuatan dalam jenis kelamin mereka.",
  "Alice menarik sekaligus terkendali, dan ini membuatnya merasa superior, bahkan saat dia menyaksikan Profesor Grimes menghilang ke kamar hotel dengan wanita lain dari konferensi.",
  "Alice berbeda dari mereka.",
  "Mereka adalah calon istri, dan dia adalah seorang penyihir.",
  "",
  "Suatu kali di kantor dia bekerja lembur ketika Profesor Grimes masuk dengan seorang wanita pirang yang cekikikan dan sempoyongan.",

  "Namanya Charlotte, dia berasal dari Kensington, dan dia memiliki kepribadian yang lincah dan terawat yang membuatmu merasa bersalah karena menyita waktunya.",

  "Tetap saja, dia seharusnya memberitahukan keberadaannya; dan karena dia tidak melakukannya saat mereka pertama kali masuk gedung, dia tidak bisa melakukannya sekarang tanpa mengejutkan mereka.",
  "",
  "Dia tidak bisa sampai ke pintu tanpa terlihat.",
  "Dia tidak ingin berjongkok di bawah mejanya dan bersembunyi, seperti orang bodoh.",

  "Mereka tidak sampai ke sana.",

  "Charlotte tersentak.",
  "Profesor Grimes mengangkat kakinya; menghempaskan punggungnya ke dinding; melakukan sesuatu dengan tangannya yang membuat suara Charlotte naik beberapa oktaf—satu erangan tunggal, berlari naik turun tangga nada.",
  "",
  "Alice terpaku di tempat, terpesona dan ngeri, bertanya-tanya apakah ini tablo yang ingin dia ikuti.",
  "Charlotte mengerang sekali lagi.",
  "Tangan Alice tergelincir, dan menyenggol gelas kimia.",
  "Gelas itu tidak pecah—terlalu jauh dari tepi—tetapi berdenting dengan gelas kimia lain, dan suaranya menusuk ruangan.",

  "Profesor Grimes mendongak dengan mata sayu yang terkunci pada matanya.",
  "Dia tidak menghentikan jamahannya.",
  "",
  "Jantung Alice berhenti berdetak.",
  "",
  "Dia menyambar lencananya dan bergegas keluar saat itu juga.",
  "Dia merasakan mata Profesor Grimes membakar punggungnya sepanjang jalan keluar gedung, dan baru setelah dia menerobos pintu depan, ke dalam dinginnya malam, dia mengambil napas.",
  "",
  "Dia rasa Charlotte tidak pernah tahu dia ada di sana.",
  "Dia bertanya-tanya, kadang-kadang, ketika berpapasan dengan Charlotte di lorong.",
  "Dalam beberapa minggu berikutnya dia melihat Charlotte menjadi ceria ketika Profesor Grimes melewati kantornya; bahunya merosot ketika pria itu tidak membalas lambaiannya.",
  "Dia memperhatikan perubahan kecil dalam penampilan Charlotte—bagaimana dia berhenti memakai lipstik, bagaimana dia tidak lagi memadukan blus dengan sepatunya, bagaimana semakin sering rambutnya tampak tidak dicuci dan tidak disisir.",
  "Dia memperhatikan Charlotte memelototi wanita lain di departemen, Belinda khususnya; mata menyipit, jari-jari memelintir.",
  "Dia bertanya-tanya kadang-kadang ketika menatap wajah Charlotte yang berbayang dan lesu apakah Charlotte mungkin akan curhat padanya—tetapi yang dia dapatkan sebagai balasan hanyalah sapaan sopan, “Pagi, Alice.”",
  "",
  "Dia bertanya-tanya kadang-kadang apakah dia mengarang atau melebih-lebihkan seluruh pertemuan itu; apakah pikirannya telah mengembara, seperti yang selalu terjadi selama masa-masa lembur ini.",

  "",
  "Dia tidak bisa membedakan di mana pelanggaran Profesor Grimes berakhir dan di mana keterlibatannya dimulai.",
  "Dia tidak bisa memilah apa kesalahan yang telah dia lakukan.",
  "",
  "Jadi ketika semuanya menjadi terlalu berat—ketika itu mulai mengganggu studinya, ketika dia mulai merasa kurang seperti cendekiawan sejati di mata pria itu dan lebih seperti sepasang kaki berjalan—dia tidak punya siapa-siapa untuk disalahkan selain dirinya sendiri karena bertingkah seperti jalang bodoh yang mabuk kepayang.",
  "",
  "Dia seharusnya tahu lebih baik sejak awal.",
  "",
  "Dia adalah domba yang berjalan lurus ke kandang singa, karena dia ingin melihat apa yang diributkan orang-orang.",
  "Jauh di lubuk hatinya, sebagian dari dirinya ingin dilahap.",
  "Dan dia merasa bahwa Profesor Grimes, pastinya, telah melihat itu begitu dia menatap matanya malam itu.",
  "Bahwa mungkin Profesor Grimes sudah mengetahui hal ini tentang dirinya sejak awal.",
  "",
  "Itu terjadi pada malam mereka kembali dari makan malam Penghargaan Leverhulme; pusing, gembira, keduanya mabuk oleh perhatian yang mereka terima sepanjang malam.",
  "Mereka naik kereta malam kembali dari stasiun Liverpool Street, lalu taksi kembali ke departemen—departemen, bukan penginapan masing-masing, karena Profesor Grimes telah memutuskan di stasiun bahwa mereka harus mampir dulu ke kantornya untuk mengambil beberapa dokumen dan Alice, yang senang dan kelelahan, tidak terpikir untuk mempertanyakan alasan usang ini.",
  "",
  "Di departemen mereka terus terkikik, menabrak berbagai benda.",
  "Profesor Grimes kehilangan keseimbangan dan menyapukan tangannya melalui serangkaian algoritma yang telah dikerjakan Michele di papan tulis sepanjang minggu, lengkungan lima jari yang sempurna melalui lapisan kapur yang tebal, dan ini terasa sangat lucu bagi mereka berdua.",
  "Di kantornya, Profesor Grimes mengusulkan agar mereka mulai menyusun rencana pelajaran untuk semester depan, yang merupakan dalih konyol karena tak satu pun dari mereka dalam keadaan yang memungkinkan untuk merencanakan pelajaran semester.",
  "",
  "Di kantornya mereka membuat diorama orang-orang bodoh yang sempurna; menabrak pintu, menjatuhkan barang-barang mereka, meraba-raba kunci.",

  "",
  "Helen tidak terlalu menyukai Alice.",
  "Bukan karena apa pun yang pernah dilakukan Alice, tetapi karena dia adalah mahasiswa Grimes, dan Helen Murray serta Jacob Grimes saling membenci.",

  "Apa kau tidak tahu?”",
  "",
  "Alice tidak bisa menentukan apakah Helen sedang bercanda.",
  "Dia mengerti referensinya; dia juga pernah melihat ukiran kayu Phyllis telanjang, selir Alexander, menunggangi Aristoteles seperti kuda.",

  "",
  "“Tapi itu tidak—maksudku, cara mereka memperlakukan perempuan, itu tidak adil.”",

  "Bibir Helen melengkung.",
  "“Ah, kau seorang feminis sekarang!”",
  "",
  "Ini adalah sindiran tajam—tanda-tanda pertama dari sebuah jebakan, tetapi Alice terlalu tertekan untuk melihat apa yang telah dia masuki.",
  "Helen menjadi tuan rumah konferensi tahunan Perempuan dalam Sihir di Cambridge, tetapi Alice tidak pernah pergi.",
  "Tak seorang pun di angkatannya repot-repot pergi.",
  "Belinda pergi sekali pada tahun pertamanya, dan kembali sambil memutar matanya—Hanya sekumpulan nenek sihir, berharap para pria mati.",
  "Tidak, tak seorang pun di angkatannya adalah seorang feminis; mereka menghindari label itu, mereka pikir itu hanya akan membawa masalah bagi mereka.",

  "",
  "“Tentu saja.” Helen meletakkan cangkirnya.",
  "“Jadi kenapa kau datang padaku?”",
  "",
  "Itu seharusnya sudah jelas, pikir Alice.",

  "“Karena kita punya banyak kesamaan?”",
  "",
  "Ini juga pertanyaan jebakan, tapi Alice memakan umpannya.",

  "",
  "Perangkap itu terpicu.",

  "",
  "Terpikir oleh Alice bahwa Helen telah menunggu lama untuk mengucapkan kata-kata ini; telah menimbun pidato ini, mengawasinya dan Belinda dan yang lainnya di aula, menunggu yang pertama mampir.",
  "Ini bukan tentang dia lagi; ini bahkan bukan tentang Grimes; ini tentang Helen yang menyampaikan pendapatnya, dan Alice hanyalah penontonnya.",
  "",
  "Helen condong ke depan.",
  "“Perbedaan antara wanita sepertiku dan gadis sepertimu adalah kami selalu mengerti bahwa pertempuran tidak pernah berakhir.",
  "Angkatanmu telah memilih untuk hidup seolah aturan tidak berlaku untuk kalian.",
  "Dan tampaknya berhasil.",
  "Aku salut pada kalian gadis-gadis, aku mendukung kalian.",
  "Aku berharap aku bisa melakukan hal yang sama.",
  "Tapi kau tidak bisa begitu saja berteriak minta tolong saat hal-hal tidak berjalan sesuai keinginanmu.",
  "Apa yang harus kau sadari, Alice, adalah bahwa kau tidak bisa begitu saja berlindung pada feminisme saat itu menguntungkanmu.”",
  "",
  "“Aku tidak berteriak minta tolong,” kata Alice putus asa.",
  "“Aku hanya—aku butuh bimbingan—”",

  "“Kau ingin ganti pembimbing, kalau begitu?",

  "",
  "Ini mengejutkan Alice.",
  "Dia tidak berencana untuk bertanya; bahkan tidak menganggapnya sebagai solusi.",

  "Rekrutan pasangan yang pakai korset?”",
  "",
  "“Aku tidak . . .”",
  "",
  "Oh, tapi Alice memang berpikir begitu.",
  "Mereka semua mengatakannya.",
  "Mereka menerima gosip itu pertama kali dari pembimbing mereka dan mereka cekikikan tentang hal itu di antara mereka sendiri, bercerita pada larut malam di pub—apakah Helen bahkan menerbitkan karya, apakah ada yang menganggap Helen serius, apa yang akan terjadi ketika pria itu menceraikan sapi betina itu?",
  "Tapi telinga profesor jauh lebih dekat ke tanah daripada yang dipikirkan siapa pun.",
  "Alice seharusnya tahu ini, karena dia tahu Grimes sangat sadar akan segala sesuatu yang dikatakan orang tentangnya.",

  "“Apa?",
  "Tidak—”",

  "Alice merasa sangat bodoh saat itu.",
  "",
  "Kenapa dia tidak punya jawaban?",
  "Kenapa pertanyaan ini begitu sulit?",
  "Seolah-olah dia duduk untuk ujian, hanya untuk menemukan dia tidak memahami materi apa pun.",
  "Semua kontradiksi memuncak, dan dia tidak bisa menyintesis jawaban karena tidak ada satu pun posisinya yang masuk akal.",
  "Dia menginginkan perhatian Grimes tetapi juga rasa hormatnya.",
  "Dia memuja kekuasaan pria itu, kecuali ketika pria itu menggunakannya melawannya.",
  "Dia tidak menginginkan perlakuan khusus untuk jenis kelaminnya, namun dia merasa dirugikan, dengan cara yang dia rasa hanya perempuan yang bisa dirugikan.",
  "Helen benar—dia tidak bisa memiliki semuanya, tidak bisa mempercayai semua yang dia lakukan dan masih mengeluh.",
  "Tapi tetap saja, bukankah ada yang salah di sini?",
  "Apakah dia begitu salah karena merasa sakit hati?",
  "",
  "Dia mencoba memilah pertanyaan paling mendasar.",
  "Apa yang dia inginkan?",
  "Jika dia bisa mengayunkan tongkat sihir untuk memperbaiki ini, hasil apa yang akan dia dapatkan?",
  "",
  "Itu bermuara pada satu hal: dia ingin Grimes menghormatinya, menyukainya lagi, kembali menjadi gurunya lagi.",
  "Tapi Helen tidak bisa membantunya di sana.",
  "Sikap Grimes terhadapnya adalah fakta yang tak tergoyahkan.",
  "Dia tidak bisa mengubahnya dengan berharap.",
  "",
  "Kenyataannya, semua keinginannya konyol.",
  "Dia ingin semua itu tidak pernah terjadi.",
  "Dia ingin pikirannya kembali.",
  "Dan dia ingin menjadi lebih dari sekadar tubuh, lebih dari sekadar daging, sesuatu untuk ditulis dan diamati dan mungkin diraba-raba saat kau bosan.",
  "Dia menginginkan versi yang dijanjikan padanya, dia menginginkan guru yang peduli padanya, yang menghormatinya sebagai pemikir, yang tidak memperlakukannya sebagai alat.",
  "",
  "Tapi semua ini adalah dongeng.",
  "Dalam menegakkan pesona tanpa henti, dia telah menutup opsi-opsi lainnya.",
  "Dan sekarang dia tertinggal dalam perangkap yang dia bangun untuk dirinya sendiri.",
  "",
  "Tidak ada gunanya, pikirnya tak berdaya.",
  "Tidak ada gunanya mendobrak keluar.",
  "Mencoba hanya akan menghancurkan segalanya.",
  "Berhenti percaya pada satu postulat, dan seluruh bangunan itu runtuh.",
  "Kau tidak dapat memiliki permukaan Euclidean yang stabil tanpa postulat sejajar; kau tidak dapat bertahan hidup tanpa percaya bahwa kau kebal.",
  "Jadi satu-satunya pilihanmu adalah rekonstruksi kebohongan itu—aku tidak berwujud, ini tidak mungkin penting, dan jadi ini tidak penting.",
  "",
  "“Jadi kau mengerti.” Ekspresi Helen bukannya tanpa simpati.",
  "“Hanya akan menyakitimu jika membawa ini lebih jauh.",
  "Hal terbaik yang bisa kau lakukan untuk kariermu sekarang adalah melupakan itu pernah terjadi.”",
  "",
  "Aku tidak bisa, Alice ingin menangis.",
  "Aku tidak bisa melupakan apa pun.",
  "",
  "“Grimes pasti akan melupakannya.” Mulut Helen berkedut.",
  "“Dia akan beralih ke mahasiswa baru berikutnya pada Michaelmas, dan kemudian semuanya akan berjalan seperti biasa denganmu.",
  "Dan bagaimanapun—seperti katamu, itu hanya ciuman.”",
  "",
  "Bukan hanya ciuman, pikir Alice.",
  "Tatonya membakar panas membara, panas seperti hari pria itu mengukirnya di kulitnya.",
  "Tapi ini tidak bisa dia ungkapkan.",
  "Dia telah menjanjikan diamnya pada Grimes; dia masih ingin menjadi gadis yang sangat baik.",
  "",
  "Dan dia curiga Helen tahu, bagaimanapun juga.",
  "Bukan detailnya.",
  "Hanya bentuknya.",
  "Helen pasti tahu, karena dia pernah melihat semuanya terjadi sebelumnya, pasti pernah melaluinya sendiri, dan di sini dia masih duduk di tempatnya berada.",
  "Kantornya sendiri.",
  "Jendela halaman, meja mahoni, jabatan tetap.",
  "Apa yang dibutuhkan untuk itu?",
  "Alice bertanya-tanya.",
  "Sangkar keyakinan apa yang membuat Helen terus bertahan?",
  "",
  "Helen tidak mengejeknya.",
  "Dia telah menjabarkan cetak birunya.",
  "Percayai kebohongan itu—percayai kebohongan itu—itu satu-satunya hal yang kau miliki.",
  "Tetaplah di dalam sangkar dan cat dindingnya.",
  "Jika kau tidak melakukannya, maka kau harus berhenti; tetapi jika kau bisa menipu dirimu sendiri cukup lama, maka delusimu mungkin akan menjadi kenyataan.",

  "“Terima kasih,” Alice berhasil berkata.",
  "“Ini sangat membantu.”",

  "“Sama-sama,” kata Helen.",
  "“Habiskan tehmu.”",
  "",
  "Setelah pertemuan itu Alice mulai bermimpi tentang kematian.",
  "",
  "Bukan berarti dia membuat rencana aktif untuk mengakhiri hidupnya.",
  "Itu butuh terlalu banyak inisiatif.",
  "Lebih sering dia akan berjalan di sepanjang Sidney Street saat bus-bus melesat lewat dan merenung bahwa tidak akan terlalu buruk jika salah satunya kebetulan menabraknya.",
  "Dia suka membayangkan tulang-tulangnya remuk; darahnya berceceran di trotoar.",
  "Dia membuat permainan dengan bertanya-tanya apa, tepatnya, yang akan menjadi penyebab kematian akut—pecahnya tengkoraknya ke dalam otaknya?",
  "Itu akan menjadi yang terbaik—jauh lebih buruk adalah pembelahan internal yang berantakan yang menghancurkanmu tanpa bisa diperbaiki tetapi membiarkan utuh kemampuanmu untuk merasakan sakit, kemampuanmu untuk berpikir dan merenung bahwa inilah akhirnya.",
  "Jika dia akan mati, dia ingin melakukannya dengan kepala lebih dulu.",
  "",
  "Lagipula, mati tampaknya dapat diterima secara moral.",
  "Argumen terbaik yang bisa dibuat Socrates menentang bunuh diri di Phaedo adalah bahwa manusia fana itu seperti milik para dewa, dan bahwa para dewa akan kesal jika salah satu milik mereka membebaskan diri dari penjara fana mereka dengan penghancuran diri.",
  "Larangan Kristen terhadap bunuh diri tampaknya hanya merupakan pembingkaian ulang dari itu.",
  "Tetapi kepentingan Tuhan tampaknya tidak relevan di sini.",
  "Mungkin teman-teman dan keluarganya akan sedih—pikirannya mengembara samar-samar ke orang tuanya di Colorado, terisak saat mereka menutup telepon—tetapi dia tidak bisa membayangkan siapa pun akan sangat merindukannya.",
  "Tampaknya tidak banyak yang bisa diperjuangkan.",
  "",
  "Bagaimana dia bisa menjelaskannya?",
  "Apa yang menghancurkan bukanlah sentuhan itu—pria itu hampir tidak melakukan kekerasan padanya.",
  "Tidak, yang menyakitkan adalah betapa mudahnya pria itu bisa mereduksinya menjadi sebuah benda.",
  "Bukan lagi seorang murid, seorang pemikir, makhluk ingin tahu yang tumbuh dan belajar dan menjadi di bawah bimbingannya—tetapi hanya identitas paling dasar yang selama ini dia takutkan, yaitu sekadar perempuan.",
  "Semuanya klise sialan.",
  "Bagaimana dia bisa berani berpikir itu tidak berlaku?",
  "Gadis masuk ke akademi, dan para lelaki menjadi kasar.",
  "Dia merasa terlempar ke dalam cerita yang sudah sering diceritakan yang akhirnya sudah tertulis, dan dia tidak punya pilihan selain mengikuti, mengucapkan dialognya, dan menunggu tirai ditutup.",
  "Dan rasanya, selama hari-hari itu, hal termudah baginya adalah melompat saja dari panggung.",
  "",
  "Tetapi dia tidak pernah menemukan tekad untuk mengakhiri segalanya demi kebaikan.",
  "Bukan karena dia takut sakit—karena pada saat itu dia tidak yakin dia masih bisa merasakan sakit—tetapi karena rasa malu.",
  "Karena bahkan setelah segalanya, terlepas dari betapa mati rasanya dia, yang tertinggal adalah prinsip-prinsip dunia akademis, yang begitu membakar tulang-tulangnya sehingga bahkan di saat-saat terlemahnya dia masih merasakan gemanya.",
  "",
  "Jika dia mati, mereka akan berpikir dia telah gagal.",

  "Alice yang malang, kata mereka.",
  "Satu lagi mahasiswa Grimes yang dibuat gila.",

  "Alice bisa menanggung rasa sakit apa pun.",
  "Tapi dia tidak bisa menanggung rasa malu itu.",
  "Masih penting baginya, di atas segalanya, bahwa mereka menghormatinya sebagai seorang cendekiawan.",

  "Jadi dia terus berjalan tertatih-tatih; muncul di kuliah, menjaga jam kerjanya di laboratorium, menilai makalah dan menggambar pentagram dan mengisi otaknya dengan segala macam informasi yang tidak berguna.",

  "",
  "Saat dia meninggalkan departemen itulah ingatan itu membanjir kembali.",
  "Dia tidak bisa tidur; dia hanya bisa berbaring dalam kegelapan, menatap langit-langit saat wajah Profesor Grimes membayang dalam imajinasinya.",
  "Dia berhenti makan; semua yang dia masukkan ke mulutnya membuat perutnya mual.",
  "Rambutnya mulai rontok.",
  "Kulitnya berubah abu-abu.",
  "Orang-orang memanggilnya, orang-orang mencoba membantu.",
  "Dia nyaris tidak mendengar mereka; dia tidak menjawab.",
  "Dia mendengar dengungan aneh di telinganya sepanjang waktu.",
  "Dunia terasa diredam dan terdistorsi, seolah-olah dia bergerak di bawah air.",
  "",
  "Tetap saja dia terus berjalan.",
  "Dia tidak tahu apa lagi yang harus dilakukan.",
  "Rencananya, jika dia bisa menyebutnya begitu, hanyalah menjadi robot sampai pusatnya tidak bisa lagi bertahan; sampai dia hancur berkeping-keping di luar kehendaknya.",
  "",
  "Tapi Profesor Grimes-lah yang hancur lebih dulu—secara harfiah, semua daging dan isi perut dan tulangnya terentak lepas dengan gaya sentrifugal dari jutaan tahun energi kapur mayat hidup yang tersimpan.",
  "",
  "Dan Alice—yang berdiri mematung dengan otak dan serpihan tengkorak serta darah pria itu berceceran di wajahnya—tidak bisa berhenti tertawa.",
  "Karena jalan keluar telah terbuka pada akhirnya.",

  "And I learned about these ruins, see, called the Colossi of Memnon.",
  "They’re these two colossal statues in Thebes built to guard the tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh, but they’ve been associated with the Trojan king Memnon since antiquity.",
  "For thousands of years, every morning at dawn, these statues have emitted a high-pitched cry.",
  "We don’t know what causes it.",
  "Maybe it’s the heat of the sun expanding the rocks so the wind hits them at just the right angle.",

  "“So then I went searching in the Greek archives.",
  "It took forever to track down any manuscripts of hers, as they weren’t even classified in the magick library, but finally I found some old scraps of papyrus that are carbon-dated to Thessaly.",

  "“In Dante’s Inferno, Erichtho is passingly mentioned as the one other person who has sent Virgil into the depths of Hell.",
  "Scholars are divided on what Dante was trying to accomplish with this mention.",
  "Some think it’s to reassure the reader that Virgil knows his way around Lower Hell; others think it’s to emphasize Virgil’s paganism by associating him with witchcraft.",

  "Dia tidak pernah setengah-setengah, dia selalu menuntaskannya.",
  "Dan sebagian dari diriku, jauh di lubuk hati, sebenarnya bersemangat.",
  "Karena aku terus membayangkannya bangun untuk melihat apa yang telah kulakukan.”",

  "Mereka berdua menatap buku catatan itu.",
  "",
  "Alice belum meninjau kembali halaman-halaman ini sejak ia mencoret-coretkan catatannya.",
  "Ia takjub sekarang melihat tulisan tangannya sendiri, coretan panik yang sama sekali tidak mirip dengan tulisannya yang biasa rapi.",
  "Ia ingat jam-jam terakhir penelitian itu, duduk membungkuk di atas tulisan Erichtho di samping lampu redup dan berdengung, memaksa tangannya untuk mengimbangi pikirannya yang berpacu.",
  "Di beberapa titik ia menekan begitu keras ke halaman sehingga ujung pensilnya patah, meninggalkan noda arang.",
  "Buku catatan Peter tampak biasa saja jika dibandingkan.",
  "Miliknya sendiri tampak seperti hasil karya orang gila.",
  "",
  "Dengan suara lirih ia bertanya, “Jadi kau tidak berpikir aku gila?”",
  "",
  "Peter mengulurkan tangan; jari-jarinya menggenggam jemarinya.",
  "",
  "Dan meskipun yang mereka lakukan hanyalah duduk, diam, dan meskipun mereka masih tidak punya solusi dan tidak ada jalan keluar, entah bagaimana Alice merasa lebih jernih daripada sebelumnya dalam waktu yang sangat lama.",
  "Ia merasa tenang, pikirannya tenteram.",
  "Seolah-olah ia telah meronta-ronta di udara, mengepak-ngepak dan tercekik, dan di sinilah akhirnya seseorang memberinya tempat untuk mendarat.",
  "",
  "Waktu beringsut maju.",
  "Tengkorak itu terus bersuara.",
  "Awalnya Alice terus memeriksa arlojinya, tapi tak lama kemudian ia berhenti melakukannya.",
  "Menit, jam, tidak masalah.",
  "Mereka tidak punya jalan keluar.",
  "",
  "Keluarga Kripke belum datang.",
  "Ini memberi Alice sedikit secercah harapan—bahwa mungkin keluarga Kripke telah melupakan mereka, bahwa mungkin alih-alih kematian berdarah yang mengerikan, mereka hanya akan mati dengan tenang dan terbekap.",
  "Keluarga Kripke tidak terburu-buru.",
  "Mereka tidak perlu bergulat dengan dua orang dewasa.",
  "Mereka hanya perlu menunggu mereka.",
  "Dan keluarga Kripke punya waktu selamanya.",
  "",
  "Ia mempertimbangkan untuk menangisinya, tapi udaranya terlalu panas dan kering; pada titik ini ia tidak memiliki cukup cairan di tubuhnya untuk mengembun menjadi air mata.",
  "",
  "Apakah ini akhirnya?",
  "Ia mengevaluasi hidupnya, semua mimpi dan usaha serta aspirasi putus asanya, dan tidak bisa merasakan apa pun selain geli yang menyedihkan atas posisinya saat ini.",
  "",
  "Ia pernah mengambil kelas filsuf Yunani selama tahun pertamanya kuliah, sebelum ia menyadari bahwa ia alergi terhadap filsafat.",
  "Ia tidak terlalu peduli pada Socrates, tapi ia suka cara Aristoteles menulis tentang dunia, jiwa, bentuk makhluk hidup.",
  "Aristoteles memiliki keyakinan besar pada dorongan mereka untuk berkembang.",
  "Dan ia ingat membaca argumen Aristoteles tentang bagaimana setiap makhluk hidup, bahkan organisme paling primitif sekalipun, dijiwai oleh gagasan tentang kebaikan.",
  "Bahkan tanaman pun menghadapkan wajahnya ke matahari.",
  "Bahkan semut terkecil pun mencari makan; cacing tanpa otak mencari tanah.",
  "Semuanya begitu mudah bagi makhluk hidup—semua kecuali manusia, kecuali orang-orang seperti dia, yang punya bakat untuk mencari apa yang hanya membuat mereka sengsara.",
  "",
  "Sepanjang hidupnya, tampaknya, ia telah berlari kencang ke arah yang salah.",
  "Bukan karena kurangnya kesempatan.",
  "Ia tahu betul di mana matahari bersinar, namun terikat oleh dorongan hati untuk mengubur dirinya sendiri dalam kegelapan.",
  "",
  "Mungkin kecerdasan manusia adalah sebuah kesalahan, dan semua orang yang merayakan pelarian dari Taman Eden adalah salah.",
  "Mungkin karunia rasionalitas tidak sebanding dengan penderitaan hebat yang menyertainya.",
  "",
  "Atau mungkin orang-orang seperti Alice pada dasarnya memang rusak.",
  "Mungkin mereka menyia-nyiakan hidup; mungkin kematian adalah hal terbaik untuknya.",
  "Mungkin ia lebih mirip organisme Freud daripada tanaman Aristoteles, yang didorong secara kompulsif menuju kematian, menuju keadaan tenang dan mati dari segala sesuatu sebelum mereka mengalami nasib sial karena dilahirkan.",
  "Ia menyuarakan teori ini kepada Peter.",
  "",
  "“Hm,” katanya.",
  "“Aku tidak berpikir kita secara kompulsif mencari kematian.”",
  "",
  "“Itu kan kau.”",
  "",
  "“Aku hanya berpikir kita terjerat.",
  "“Tapi kita masih berusaha menghadap cahaya.”",
  "",
  "Mereka mengobrol sebentar.",
  "Kenangan-kenangan tak berarti, pengamatan-pengamatan hambar.",
  "Makanan yang pernah mereka makan.",
  "Buku yang pernah mereka baca.",
  "Satu atau dua kali Alice membuat Peter tertawa, dan itu tampak seperti kemenangan terbesar yang bisa ia capai saat itu; bahwa ia masih bisa memancing tawa tercekiknya.",
  "",
  "Suara mereka menjadi serak, lidah mereka kering, suara mereka pelan.",
  "Akhirnya mereka terdiam.",
  "",
  "Alice menduga ada cara mati yang lebih buruk.",
  "Setidaknya ia tahu tidak ada yang perlu ia takuti.",
  "Setidaknya ia tidak mati sendirian.",
  "",
  "Dan ia tidak bisa menyangkal bagian dari dirinya yang lega karena akhirnya semua itu di luar kendalinya; bahwa tidak ada lagi gunanya menyusun siasat, merapal mantra, dan berjuang.",
  "Akhirnya ada tanda titik untuk semua itu, dan ia tidak bisa mengendalikannya.",
  "Ini adalah sebuah penghiburan.",
  "",
  "“Alice.”",

  "",
  "“Oh, padahal kita sedang menikmati momen yang menyenangkan.”",
  "Alice membiarkan lengannya terkulai lemas di lengan Peter.",
  "Pengakuan ini tidak terlalu mengganggunya lagi—sekarang setelah mereka akan mati, mengetahui Peter akan membunuhnya seandainya ia berhasil adalah hal yang mengecewakan, tapi bukan kejutan.",

  "Oh, kekosongan yang manis; ketiadaan pikiran.",

  "",
  "Peter Murdoch never meant to hurt anyone.",
  "He was not like Alice; he didn’t have vicious determination.",
  "Peter did not hold grudges or acknowledge rivals, in part because he was so used to winning by default.",
  "Peter Murdoch was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and a stick of chalk in hand.",
  "For him academia was a playground, not a battlefield, and he was just so good at all the games.",
  "",
  "Yet this made him dangerous in his own way.",
  "For Peter had gone through life blithely assuming things would just fall in place precisely how he needed them, since in most respects, they always had.",
  "This made him careless.",
  "He never thought much of the consequences, or about much in particular except his own research.",
  "And it was only when things went sideways, when things got carried away, when the domino effects of his whims cascaded far beyond anything he’d hoped or intended—only then did he discover how dangerous being careless could be.",
  "",
  "Peter was five when his genius became evident.",
  "He was stuck ill at home, and was not getting better as quickly as hoped, and his parents had deemed it necessary to engage a home maths tutor so that Peter would not fall behind.",
  "This tutor—one of his father’s advisees, who would have happily done anything else if not for need of pocket money—took the pedagogically irresponsible approach of feeding him one algebraic exercise at a time while distracted by his own pile of problem sets to grade.",
  "",
  "Peter traipsed happily through the problems.",
  "And since he was not in a classroom full of children cooing over crayons, and since all his attention wasn’t spent on not drawing attention to himself, he let himself skate through the next lesson, and then the next.",
  "The way Peter saw it, he was only happily solving the next problem as it appeared.",
  "He didn’t notice his tutor’s jaw slackening over the hour.",
  "",
  "“He’s astonishing,” the postgrad reported to his father.",
  "“He doesn’t belong in year one, you’ve got to get him out of there.”",
  "",
  "Peter’s parents—his dad a mathematician, his mum a biologist—were overjoyed by this news; for all academic parents hope and expect to have smart children but don’t dare admit out loud that they want genius children.",
  "But it seemed Peter was in fact a genius, and so they made arrangements for him to be surrounded by tutors all the time, stimulating his brain with advanced studies.",
  "",
  "This was a good thing, for otherwise Peter’s childhood would have passed in tedious solitude.",
  "For the other defining trait about Peter was that he was so often sick.",
  "At first it seemed he was a classically persnickety child, always caught up with a round of upset tummy or food poisoning or diarrhea or constipation.",
  "He’ll grow out of it, said his grandparents; some children just like to catch every germ in the air.",
  "By the time he was six, however, it became clear that whatever Peter had was severe and chronic.",
  "Medical research on inflammatory bowel diseases would come quite a long way over the course of Peter’s lifetime.",
  "But in his early childhood, the most that any doctor could tell his family was that his colon seemed to be getting inflamed for no apparent reason, and that he would do best to avoid wheat flour.",
  "This later expanded to include dairy, nuts, and raw vegetables—indeed, Peter spent a lot of time on elimination diets.",
  "They couldn’t tell if any of it helped, only that all-liquid diets—that is, bone broth and apple juice—seemed to improve things when he was at his worst, but only because it meant there was nothing in his bowels left to clear.",
  "",
  "At last, after many specialist visits and misdiagnoses, he was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease—a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with no known cause and no cure.",
  "Peter and his parents began referring to his condition as the Beast.",
  "It helped to personify the disease, for otherwise it was just a mysterious thing that messed with his sense of self.",
  "His own immune system was attacking his own cells for no clear reason.",
  "Easier to think of it as some capricious, alien entity.",
  "Sometimes the Beast left him alone.",
  "Sometimes it gnawed relentlessly at his insides.",
  "Sometimes it withdrew for several weeks, just long enough for him to make plans to go to birthday parties and the beach and go hiking, which he’d still never done, before returning with a vengeance.",
  "The Beast was unknowable, unpredictable.",
  "The only constant they knew about the Beast was that it couldn’t ever be vanquished; only kept at bay, hidden from, for brief pockets of time.",
  "",
  "Peter grew used to doctor’s visits.",
  "Crohn’s had a number of side effects as a consequence of malnutrition.",
  "His eyes were always red and scabby.",
  "His teeth were all wrong.",
  "Every now and then a big red rash appeared all over his back, which no number of oatmeal baths would alleviate.",
  "He was chronically underweight, and because the first course of treatment for a Crohn’s flare was immunosuppressants, he was also chronically suffering from whatever seasonal bug was floating around.",
  "There was never a time when Peter was not coughing or sniffling or vomiting; indeed, if ever the rare day came when he appeared in good health, his parents only braced themselves for a vicious flare to come.",
  "",
  "Peter took this all in good cheer.",
  "He had no siblings nor friends in the neighborhood; he did not have a “normal childhood” as a comparison case.",
  "Poor health was just something he had to deal with.",
  "Otherwise, he had his tutors.",
  "He didn’t need sports when he could stretch his mind; he didn’t need the outdoors when he had entire abstract universes unfolding in his imagination, their secrets waiting to be explored.",
  "",
  "He loved numbers because they behaved the way they were supposed to, because the rules never changed.",
  "The square root of sixty-four never ceased to be eight.",
  "",
  "Most of the time, he had such fun that he nearly forgot he was a sick child, shut up in his room, with no friends.",
  "",
  "Still, Peter’s parents felt that he needed to spend some time with children his own age.",
  "Therefore on his eighth birthday, during a months-long stretch in which Peter was actually feeling quite well, his parents invited his third-grade class over for a birthday party.",
  "Peter had spent so little time in class that semester that he hardly knew anyone’s names, yet everyone invited turned up to his home, bringing presents and good cheer.",
  "",
  "“Look who’s popular,” said his mother.",
  "",
  "Peter, venturing out of his bedroom, felt quite overwhelmed by the crowd and the noise.",
  "“What am I supposed to do?” he asked.",
  "",
  "“Socialize,” said his father.",
  "“It’s good for your development.”",
  "",
  "“But how?”",
  "",
  "“Just give it a try.”",
  "His father pushed him toward the stairs.",
  "“Have fun.”",
  "",
  "He did try, and he had enormous fun.",
  "Peter had never spent so much time with other children; he had never experienced the joys of hide-and-seek, or playing tag, or pin the tail on the donkey.",
  "And even though he was terrible at finding hiding places, and even though he was by far the slowest in the group, everyone cheered at his minor victories; everyone laughed with him, not at him.",
  "",
  "For three hours that afternoon Peter felt funny, charming, adored.",
  "Everyone was so nice!",
  "And he even seemed to keep catching the attention of Jemma Davies, who even Peter knew was widely acknowledged as the prettiest girl in the neighborhood, with great big brown eyes and chestnut hair so smooth it shone.",
  "",
  "When it came time for cake and candles, Jemma sat down beside him, placed her little hand upon his, and said in a very prim and grown-up voice, “I’m so glad you’re having us over.",
  "Company is good for invalids.”",
  "",
  "“Invalids,” repeated Peter.",
  "",
  "“Well, you’re very sick, aren’t you?”",
  "Jemma squeezed his hand.",
  "“I heard your mum telling my mum.",
  "That’s why we’ve all come.",
  "We’re going to make you feel better.”",
  "",
  "She beamed at him.",
  "Peter smiled back.",
  "But everything tasted like ashes now in his mouth.",
  "He feigned a smile through the singing and candle-blowing, through the enormous pile of presents and the endless party games that came after—but the day was ruined, and he could not receive anyone’s goodwill except with suspicion.",
  "",
  "At the end of the night, he kissed Jemma Davies on the cheek and told her, “Your charity has been much appreciated.”",
  "And then he shut the door.",
  "",
  "After the cups and plates had been cleaned and the presents put away, Peter asked his parents if he might be homeschooled through his A-levels.",
  "Oh dear, they fretted; had the children been mean, had he been bullied?",
  "Not at all, he answered; they were perfectly pleasant, only he just didn’t think he could get much out of socializing with inferior minds.",
  "This could not be good for his development.",
  "",
  "That night he listened as his parents argued behind closed doors.",
  "He’s right, said his father; he is advanced, there’s no reason to hold him back.",
  "But he’s grown cold, said his mother.",
  "Inferior minds, what a term, where did he pick that up?",
  "We can’t have him growing up thinking he’s better than everyone else.",
  "",
  "This was fine, thought Peter.",
  "Let them think him cold, rude, antisocial.",
  "Growing up with a chronic illness just meant choosing between bad and worse, and Peter had determined that day that no matter what else happened, he was never again to be the object of pity.",
  "",
  "By the time Peter was sitting his A-levels, his doctors had finally settled upon a course of medication that seemed to work better than the others.",
  "It was called mercaptopurine, and it interfered with DNA synthesis so that inflamed cells could not easily divide.",
  "This had the unfortunate side effect of suppressing the rest of his immune system, which meant that Peter had to wash his hands obsessively and avoid large crowds during the winter flu season.",
  "But otherwise he could eat all the same foods, and do all the same things, as everyone else his age.",
  "So three weeks after his seventeenth birthday off he went, two trunks in tow, to the same university where his parents had met and fallen in love.",
  "",
  "Peter blossomed at Oxford.",
  "His coursework enthralled him; his tutors adored him.",
  "He tried champagne for the first time.",
  "He rode a bicycle for the first time.",
  "One week into his first term he attended a public lecture on basic paradoxes in magick and fell in love with the field; its caprice, its unknowability.",
  "Before, he had planned on entering maths or physics.",
  "But magick, it seemed, was a vast big iceberg of which they had seen only a glimpse of the tip, and it thrilled him to know how much more was left to be discovered.",
  "In those years, people were publishing groundbreaking discoveries every day.",
  "They’d just started investigations at Carne Abbas.",
  "They’d just found chalk deposits at the Agora.",
  "They were just now discovering the foundations of magick underwriting the history of the ancient world, and here he was at the center of it.",
  "Sometimes he took long walks around the colleges with no aim at all, so giddy with excitement that he could not sleep.",
  "",
  "It also became clear to him during this time that he had become what some people might call attractive.",
  "It was a marvel he grew up as tall as he did, as he’d spent most of his childhood in the bottom percentiles for his weight.",
  "But when puberty knocked it was like some trickster god pulled him by the head and ankles and stretched him out like Silly Putty, until he’d become some unrecognizable assortment of floppy hair and gangly limbs—a concoction that, when you stuffed it into a suit and tie, the boys and girls of Oxford rather liked.",
  "His proportions made him good at rowing, and once he started rowing he noticed a whole host of nice new things about his body.",
  "His arms grew strong, his chest filled out, and he learned to rub just a small squeeze of gel through his hair so it stood halfway up.",
  "",
  "All this to say, Peter got a little silly during those Oxford years.",
  "",
  "His remission was not perfect.",
  "The Beast still came every few months, and this meant hospital stays, IV steroids, and bed rest.",
  "But no one cared, Peter learned, so long as he didn’t tell anyone what was the matter, so long as he let them fill in the gaps with conjectures of their own.",
  "Never once did he say he wasn’t feeling well; he just refused to make excuses at all.",
  "He found he could get away with more and more.",
  "He could miss days of class.",
  "Weeks, even, though he tried not to be excessive.",
  "He did try never to stay home unless he was bedridden.",
  "No one ever complained; if anything his friends and tutors took it all in stride.",
  "Oh, they said; that’s just like Murdoch.",
  "Does whatever he wants, what a crazy lad.",
  "So over his three years at Oxford, he developed this reputation—an absent, erratic genius.",
  "",
  "Perhaps he leaned into it.",
  "Perhaps he put on an affectation sometimes—he would talk about solutions to problem sets in a dreamy, indifferent voice as if he hadn’t spent hours working through them, or pretend he hadn’t done the reading when in fact he’d stayed up all night.",
  "If ever he had to leave class for the bathroom, he claimed he was going for a smoke.",
  "And if ever his hospital stay lasted more than a week, he pretended he’d buggered off to Barcelona or Göttingen—this was sometimes true, since his parents liked to attend conferences and he liked to accompany them—or just stayed home and slept, because he felt like it, because Peter Murdoch didn’t need to attend lectures to ace a class.",
  "",
  "He was astonished by how well this worked.",
  "No one resented him for his absences; they only got so much more excited when he showed up.",
  "Murdoch was a rare presence; his appearance was a blessing.",
  "In a world defined by perception, Peter was learning now to construct a most compelling front.",
  "Geniuses could be excused any idiosyncrasy.",
  "They would forgive an ailing body, Peter determined, so long as they were intimidated by the mind.",
  "And oh, what a mind he would become.",
  "",
  "When it came time to discuss his future, Peter had decided firmly on a PhD in analytic magick.",
  "Maths and physics entertained him, but he was seduced by the slippery unknown; the way grappling with truth in magick felt like trying to clutch sunlight in your palm.",
  "Now, this would have made Cambridge the obvious choice, if only his parents did not have such reservations.",
  "Aoife and Howard Murdoch had done their doctorates at Oxford, which was in their view the greatest institution on earth.",
  "They were also deeply connected in the social circles of British academia, so of course they’d heard the rumors.",
  "",
  "“That man is a brute,” said his mother.",
  "“Anyhow, won’t you be happier somewhere . . . more comfortable?",
  "Why not stay at Oxford?”",
  "",
  "“Or even the New World,” said his father, who still insisted on referring to it as the New World as a bit, though no one ever laughed.",
  "“They’re doing quite innovative stuff these days, you’ll have a grand old time.",
  "Why muddle your best years away at Cambridge?”",
  "",
  "What neither of them said out loud: Are you sure you can bear it?",
  "",
  "But Peter, since childhood, had operated by two interrelated principles.",
  "",
  "First, he was only interested in doing the hardest possible thing.",
  "He was Nietzschean in this regard.",
  "Not in the weird and antisocial Übermensch way, which so many young men at Oxford had taken to heart.",
  "He was Nietzschean in the broader sense that he felt life only had purpose if he was constantly pushing himself past his own limits.",
  "He believed only the faculty at Cambridge could help him reach his limits.",
  "And he would not waste his time doing anything but his best work.",
  "",
  "Second, he hated to ever make exceptions on account of his constitution.",
  "Peter had spent his entire life being the sickly Murdoch boy.",
  "He’d been informed since childhood, usually by well-meaning and sympathetic teachers, that it was all right if he sat out this game, if he didn’t come on this field trip, if he couldn’t sit his exams, if he didn’t want to run the last lap.",
  "Peter had had quite enough of other people feeling sorry for him.",
  "He was not interested in merely keeping up with everyone else; in doing what someone without Crohn’s could.",
  "He wanted to do what people without Crohn’s could not.",
  "So when he heard the horror stories—the lab assistants who had quit, the grad students who regularly stormed out of Grimes’s office in tears—Peter took it as a challenge.",
  "",
  "Now, perhaps his time at Oxford made him overconfident in his own charm.",
  "Perhaps his peers and professors had fawned a bit much; perhaps his ego had grown a touch larger than was good for him.",
  "But Peter did not think he was wrong believing that he was something quite special—and that if anyone could ever impress Jacob Grimes, it was him.",
  "",
  "Cambridge!",
  "Peter loved it instantly; the cobblestone alleys, the winding river, the green and peaceful banks.",
  "He’d gotten the clubbing out of his system as an undergraduate—several sticky semesters at Wetherspoons were quite enough—and now he appreciated Cambridge’s quiet.",
  "There was always too much going on at Oxford.",
  "Cambridge, out in the fens, seemed like the sort of place where you could focus and get things done.",
  "The boys angling for Westminster were all studying politics, philosophy, and economics at the other place; here at Cambridge, the scientists came to dream.",
  "The Department of Analytic Magick, too, was everything he’d been promised—brilliant faculty, brilliant classmates, and a bottomless budget for chalk.",
  "Professor Grimes was exacting and formidable, just as Peter had hoped; under his tutelage Peter felt his mind being honed, a knife scraped sharp against a whetstone.",
  "",
  "And there was Alice.",
  "",
  "Alice Law.",
  "How many nights during that first year did he bike home long after midnight, giddy with the memory of her laughter?",
  "Peter had never known anyone like her—prickly, stubborn, ridiculous Alice.",
  "She had an underdog’s persistence, an artist’s creativity, and best of all she thought so differently from everyone he’d trained with at Oxford.",
  "Perhaps it was the American influence (Peter had never been to America but his father had led him to believe it was a land of iconoclasts), or perhaps it was Alice’s off-kilter sensibilities, but something about her mind was—well, rhizomatic was the best way he could describe it.",
  "She didn’t think in straight lines; she was always zigzagging outward.",
  "She was always wondering how unrelated disciplines might speak to one another, or dredging up random shit from archives no one had ever heard of.",
  "Can you imagine a world without memory?",
  "she would ask.",
  "Can we form meaningful relationships if we have the memories of goldfish?",
  "Does your pet know that they will one day die?",
  "Does teleportation equal death?",
  "Now suppose you do think teleportation is death—if you woke up, and your spouse professed they had been teleported from one side of the bed to another, would you mourn them?",
  "Never before had he met a thinker whose thoughts spiraled out into places he could not easily follow.",
  "He so loved watching her think out loud, hearing her fragmented thoughts spin into complete arguments, seeing her eyes dart around a point in space he could not see.",
  "",
  "It wasn’t just that she was brilliant.",
  "Everyone around him was brilliant; brilliance here was boring.",
  "Alice was a challenge.",
  "Alice kept him on his toes.",
  "Watch out for that one, Professor Grimes told him over tea at the faculty club.",
  "She’ll either flame out early, or she’ll win a Nobel.",
  "",
  "Yes, Peter did a lot of watching Alice.",
  "At night he dreamed of a birdlike silhouette stretching on tiptoes before a chalkboard.",
  "Head tilted, considering.",
  "",
  "It was all so romantic.",
  "For a short while Peter Murdoch had everything he had ever hoped for: an advisor who inspired him, a best friend who challenged and excited him, and a body that was stunningly cooperative.",
  "Every few weeks he biked down to the hospital for a checkup with his gastroenterologist, though deep down he’d started to suspect this was unnecessary.",
  "He was now on the longest stretch he’d ever been without a flare.",
  "Sometimes, unbelievably, it took active effort to remember the Beast at all.",
  "",
  "They said you could go into remission for decades.",
  "The Crohn’s information pamphlets were crammed with testimonials by people who one day woke up without pain, without cramps, and never felt it again for years and years.",
  "No one knows what induces remission, they said; remission is a miracle; sometimes your body just decides to stop attacking itself.",
  "Throughout his childhood Peter had never let himself dare.",
  "But as more time passed, the more it felt reasonable to hope that this was it—that he’d left the Beast behind him forever, and now he could run free.",
  "",
  "The switch flipped midway through his first year.",
  "",
  "Crohn’s could do that to you.",
  "He ought to have remembered.",
  "The Beast was never vanquished, only banished into hiding.",
  "One night he was eating spicy curries and drinking rose cardamom lassi at the Indian place across the bridge.",
  "The next morning his stomach was tight with telltale cramps; only mild just yet, but a harbinger of things to come.",
  "",
  "It escalated so quickly.",
  "This was the worst bout Peter had experienced since he was twelve.",
  "Things had gone well for so long that he had forgotten how horrific it could be—the double anvils of constant diarrhea and dehydration, the cramps and hemorrhoids, the revulsion toward putting anything in his mouth for fear it would only come back up again.",
  "In a single month he went four times to the hospital; twice first for IV drips, the third and fourth for intravenous steroid courses.",
  "He seemed to have developed a resistance to mercaptopurine, and this meant his treatment plan now consisted of hurling various things at a wall and seeing what stuck.",
  "His weight plummeted.",
  "His skin turned a translucent pale; when he looked in the mirror, he could see his veins, blue and spindly, floating underneath.",
  "",
  "He told no one.",
  "When you’d earned the reputation he had, the world afforded you a certain privacy.",
  "Everyone already had their theories about Peter Murdoch and so, when he started skipping lab days to curl up in bed, when he simply failed to turn in his grading assignments, they simply amplified those theories.",
  "Murdoch can’t be bothered.",
  "Murdoch doesn’t care.",
  "",
  "His goodwill was running out.",
  "Erratic was one thing; irresponsible was another.",
  "Jesus, Peter, Belinda snapped once, when he leaned on her one too many times to cover his sections, it’s not like the whole world revolves around you.",
  "",
  "But anything was better than being vulnerable.",
  "In Peter’s imagination, the moment anyone found out would be the moment Peter the Great’s reputation vanished, replaced by Peter the Sick’s.",
  "Peter the Invalid’s.",
  "And so even by the time he could no longer cycle home for fear of collapsing in the road, he couldn’t bear the thought of anyone knowing.",
  "Least of all Alice.",
  "",
  "He knew he’d hurt her.",
  "He saw her wounded passing looks.",
  "He felt terrible about the way he’d left things off.",
  "Never before had he felt he owed anyone an explanation, because never before had he become so close to someone that his sudden disappearance could impact their life.",
  "Before, Peter had simply slid into the background, out of orbit.",
  "He passed in and out of friendships, always a prized acquaintance, never a constant.",
  "Here Alice had become a constant.",
  "He could not give her up.",
  "",
  "Still, the memory of little Jemma Davies was stamped in his mind, and so too the terrifying moment when he could no longer tell friendship from charity.",
  "He figured he could always apologize later, make excuses, win her back over.",
  "But if they were ever to be friends again, then Alice could never know.",
  "",
  "The one person he could not lie to was Professor Grimes.",
  "Things had come to their breaking point—he was behind on too many assignments, he’d missed too many meetings.",
  "It was impossible now to skate by on reputation alone.",
  "At this point he risked losing his funding.",
  "",
  "So Peter went to his advisor’s office, medical records in hand, to beg for mercy.",
  "",
  "“But you look just fine,” said Professor Grimes, who must not have been looking very hard, for Peter by this point had lost twenty pounds and could count all his ribs in the mirror.",
  "",
  "“It’s, ah, not the kind of thing that’s so visibly apparent.”",
  "",
  "“And you’ve had it all your life.”",

  "“Diagnosed when I was six.”",

  "“But it’s only just now gotten worse.”",

  "",
  "Professor Grimes frowned.",
  "“Well, how long will this last?”",
  "",
  "“Nobody knows.",
  "It comes and goes, there’s never a set pattern.”",
  "",
  "“So you could be incapacitated for over a year.”",
  "",
  "Peter winced.",
  "“I hope not, sir.”",
  "",
  "“Isn’t there something you can take for it?”",
  "",
  "“There was,” said Peter.",
  "“It’s stopped working.",
  "There are newer medications that might work better, but they’ll take some time, and before we try that we need to control the symptoms first.",
  "And that’ll take weeks.",
  "Meanwhile, I’m not sure how much I can do.”",
  "",
  "Professor Grimes seemed thoroughly unconvinced.",
  "“I see.”",
  "",
  "Peter was not sure he would have believed himself.",
  "This seemed precisely the lie a shifty, unreliable doctoral student who had reached his limit would concoct.",
  "Perhaps it would have been better if he were missing a limb, or if a jagged scar cut across his body.",
  "Then at least the contours of his loss, and incapacity, would have been clear.",
  "As it was, Crohn’s was coming off as something completely, conveniently, made-up.",
  "A beast gnaws at me at all hours of the day, but you can’t see it.",
  "I feel so weak and scattered my mind won’t work—but here I am, speaking to you, clearly alert.",
  "My tummy hurts—what a joke.",
  "",
  "“Well.”",
  "Professor Grimes seemed unsure about what to say.",
  "Watching him try to give comfort was like watching a duck put on a suit.",
  "Aristotle said it best; certain beings were just not meant for certain functions.",
  "“Well . . . just try to get through it as best you can, won’t you?”",
  "",
  "“I will, sir,” said Peter.",
  "As if it were so easy; as if he could dismiss it all with sheer force of mind.",
  "“You won’t hear about it again.”",
  "",
  "He was halfway out the door when Professor Grimes called after him: “Murdoch—a word of advice.”",

  "“I mean there are great minds who were disabled.",
  "Edison, for one.",
  "That fellow over in Cosmology.”",
  "Peter could not tell whether Professor Grimes was mocking him, or if this was some genuine and horrifying attempt at comfort.",
  "Professor Grimes continued, “It is a great liberty, from a certain perspective—to be free of the normal human desires and distractions.",
  "I knew a great mathematician once—one Irene Fulmencio.",
  "Remarkable woman.",
  "We met in Venezuela; she’d never left her hometown.",
  "She was crippled by a childhood illness and spent her days in bedridden contemplation.",
  "She lived in a world of ideas.",
  "She thought of nothing else.",
  "She was able to think of nothing else.",

  "It was a great liberation, really.”",
  "",
  "Peter was too astonished to explain that his particular illness rather never let him forget how embodied he was.",

  "“Heavens knows you’re paid enough.”",

  "Things got a little better before they got worse, as these things tend to do.",
  "For a few weeks the steroids seemed to work, and the inflammation went down, during which Peter worked like the devil to make up for lost time.",
  "He finished the last of his grading assignments.",
  "He gave Belinda a bouquet of thank-you flowers, which earned him a flurry of cheek kisses.",
  "He passed his exams with flying colors.",
  "",
  "And then, because he had always been an overachiever, and because his best research insights always arrived during such frenzied spells, he developed an algorithm that would change the field of categorization forever.",
  "",
  "This may have sounded boring to the casual observer—and, indeed, was boring to most people in magick.",
  "Categorization was, however, of immense import to any logician.",
  "The question of how to sort and describe the world had bearing on almost every other field.",
  "Peter’s innovation was in a subtle variation of Russell’s Paradox, wherein sets themselves were not members of the sets they described—meaning things could be both normal and abnormal, or neither normal or abnormal.",
  "This had a whole range of implications for how you might suspend the nature of things, but in the interim, Peter was interested in how you might situate human beings temporarily outside of space and time.",
  "Beginner stuff.",
  "",
  "“Not bad,” said Professor Grimes, which was the highest praise Peter had ever heard him utter.",
  "“Finish your pentagram sketches and we’ll come back next week to test it.”",
  "",
  "“Yes, sir.”",
  "Peter went home, ate an ill-advised burger, and spent the next twelve hours in the bathroom.",
  "",
  "He wept often with frustration over that next week.",
  "He knew precisely what he needed to do to finish this paper.",
  "He knew the shape of the problem, knew the journey his thoughts needed to take—he simply couldn’t take his mind across.",
  "Instead he had to dwell on the number of bowel movements he had in an hour; the calories he’d ingested that day; whether two boxes of Saltine crackers was enough to keep him out of the hospital.",
  "He hated this meat sack he’d been trapped in; hated every tissue and organ that sapped his attention and energy when all he wanted to do was sit and think.",
  "He demanded so little of his body, and yet it would not even afford him this.",
  "",
  "A horrible impulse overtook him then.",
  "",
  "He decided he would not get help.",
  "Not this time.",
  "No doctors, no hospital, no medications, no waiting and watching to see how he responded to various courses of treatment.",
  "No steroids, no side effects.",
  "He was exhausted by the entire cycle.",
  "No, he would not have his mother come up and sit fretfully by his bedside, watching his every movement, flinching every time he moaned, staring at him intently as if she could heal him with the sheer force of her will.",
  "It was an outrageous and possibly suicidal commitment but once he conceived it his mind was set.",
  "It seemed the only degree of freedom he had left.",
  "The universe was unfair, so he would bait the universe.",
  "Do your fucking best, he told it.",
  "Put me in the ground.",
  "",
  "What happened is precisely what any doctor would have expected, which is that Peter rapidly deteriorated.",
  "",
  "He could never forget that final night.",
  "Lying on the bathroom floor, crying pitifully from the pain, stomach spasming every few minutes like it was tying itself into ever smaller knots.",
  "Always he would remember the burn of the bath mat against his face, that mildewed smell of wet feet.",
  "So many students have come through these quarters, he thought, and I might be the first to die here.",
  "Always he would remember praying, something he had not done for years; kneeling on his hands and knees on the bile-splattered bathroom tiles, uttering half-remembered lines from Mass—Have mercy on me, oh Lord—Christe, eleison—",
  "",
  "God don’t let me die I don’t want to die God—",
  "",
  "He did not die.",
  "The scout came in to clean the next morning and, hearing no response to his knock, decided the room was empty and came on in.",
  "Peter was unconscious on the floor.",
  "Calls were made; ambulances summoned.",
  "Peter awoke in the hospital, hooked up to an IV and steroid drip.",
  "His mother had come up from London that afternoon.",
  "A doctor came in and explained Peter needed part of his colon removed.",
  "The inflammation had grown so severe that recovery was beyond hope; he now had a stricture in his colon, and a colectomy was the only thing that might relieve his symptoms.",
  "They would take out the diseased half of his colon and reattach the nondiseased ends together.",
  "This was if Peter was lucky.",
  "If not, he’d need the whole colon out, and spend the rest of his life carrying around a stoma bag.",
  "And even if everything went well, Peter might need the whole colon out anyway—colectomies were only temporary solutions, after all; they did not cure the root disease.",
  "",
  "On the bright side there was very little Peter could have done to prevent this.",
  "Crohn’s reached this stage sooner or later; drugs stopped working, and inflamed tissue became unusable.",
  "He might have gone to the hospital earlier, but it would have made no difference, only accelerated his surgery.",
  "So despite his mother’s sullen recriminations, Peter could not blame his stubbornness for this development.",
  "Only his flawed biology.",
  "",
  "“Still,” said the gastroenterologist.",
  "“Next time we recommend coming in before you’re at risk of sepsis.”",
  "",
  "Peter did not want to hear any more.",
  "He sat through his consultations, eyes glazed over.",
  "Do whatever you need, he told his doctors; just wake me up when you’re finished.",
  "",
  "Six weeks later Peter returned on shaky feet to the department.",
  "He was prepared for some backlash.",
  "He had not told anyone he was getting surgery, after all; he’d only disappeared off the face of the earth and assumed he could clean up the mess when he returned.",
  "This had always worked for him before.",
  "But people were always inevitably upset, miffed; he’d always needed to smooth things over.",
  "",
  "Instead, all everyone wanted to talk about was the paper that Professor Grimes was publishing soon in Arcana.",
  "Had Peter heard?",
  "Apparently it was groundbreaking, was going to revolutionize the way we thought about categories.",
  "It had to do with Russell’s Paradox; wasn’t that the subject of Peter’s dissertation?",
  "They’d circulated drafts at a work in progress presentation last week; here, he could have a copy.",
  "",
  "Peter should have known, but still, reading the byline was like taking a slap to the face:",
  "",
  "NEW APPLICATIONS OF RUSSELL’S PARADOX",
  "",
  "By: Jacob Grimes",
  "",
  "Department of Arcane Magick",
  "",
  "Cambridge University",
  "",
  "Peter had never in his life had people refuse to listen to him, so he barged into Professor Grimes’s office that very afternoon with full confidence he could set this right.",
  "",
  "“That’s my research.”",
  "He slammed the draft manuscript on the desk between them.",
  "“Those are my ideas.”",
  "",
  "“And what very good ideas they are.”",
  "Professor Grimes leaned back in his chair.",
  "“Welcome back, Mr. Murdoch.",
  "Care to explain where you’ve been?”",
  "",
  "Peter pointed to the byline.",
  "“Why aren’t I a coauthor?”",
  "",
  "“Perhaps because you didn’t author any of it.”",
  "",
  "“This is theft.”",
  "",
  "“Is that so?”",
  "",
  "“I could report you.",
  "",
  "“Would you, now?”",
  "",
  "“There’s procedures,” Peter sputtered.",
  "“I could go to the board—”",
  "",
  "“And say what, precisely?",
  "That you wrote this paper?",
  "You did not.",
  "That I stole your ideas?",
  "I did not.”",
  "Professor Grimes’s voice grew louder; the whole room seemed to shrink.",
  "“From my point of view, Mr. Murdoch, you were a happy collaborator until you quit.",
  "You haven’t signed in to the lab since January.",
  "I have called and written many times, to no response.",
  "You have offered no explanation and no apologies.",
  "You dropped off the face of the map for over a month and expected me to do nothing with our findings?”",
  "",
  "I’ve been sick, Peter wanted to say, I’ve been in a hospital bed, having diseased tissue cut out of me.",
  "But an entire lifetime of denial—the anticipated disbelief; the conviction that, despite everything, he was exaggerating his own suffering for special treatment—stifled his words, and his tongue stuck in his throat.",
  "",
  "“Listen, Murdoch.",
  "I will make many excuses for talent.",
  "Great minds work at their own tempos.",
  "I know this.",
  "But you are getting lazy.",
  "And laziness does not get you published in Arcana.",
  "It gets you expelled.”",
  "",
  "What defense could Peter make?",
  "Guilty, guilty on all accounts—he had not been diligent enough; he had not met his deadlines; he had not overcome.",
  "A weak body was just the same thing as a weak mind; either might afflict you, and both disqualified you from genius.",
  "",
  "He slunk out of the office, head bowed.",
  "The lab outside was silent; everyone was looking at him.",
  "Alice met his eyes; she stepped forward, as if to speak.",
  "But Peter’s vision had narrowed to a pinprick around the door, and he brushed past her as if she were not there.",
  "",
  "Peter could only attribute what he did next to childish pride.",
  "",
  "To add insult to injury, Professor Grimes had asked Peter to contribute the proofs to the final drafts.",
  "A portion of each publication needed to involve documentation of multiple repetitions of each pentagrammic component before you could activate them with a human subject, and then documentation of multiple repetitions of all human-based iterations.",
  "This meant Peter had to go over his own stolen research with a red pen, and report back on all the mistakes he might have overlooked.",
  "Of course Peter agreed; no one could refuse a direct request from Professor Grimes and keep their funding.",
  "But this did not mean he needed to do a good job.",
  "",
  "He swore to God—he never meant to hurt anyone.",
  "The most malicious thought he ever held was that it might be nice to embarrass the professor.",
  "He knew Grimes did not double-check his own work; it was an open secret that Grimes had long gotten sloppy at details, would never finish a paper if it weren’t for an army of assistants looking things up for him.",
  "In Peter’s imagination, all this culminated in some grand public embarrassment at the summer conference of the Royal Academy of Magick perhaps, when Professor Grimes got booed and laughed off the stage for making mistakes an undergraduate would have caught.",
  "",
  "And really, Peter’s dominant motivation was just not to spend more time on the paper than Professor Grimes deserved.",
  "Why bother, if he wasn’t getting any credit?",
  "",
  "So he went through the whole stack in a single night, propped up in bed, half-heartedly scribbling corrections in the margins.",
  "He didn’t bother with retracing every pentagrammic iteration; it took so much bloody time, and required so many back-translations from Latin and Greek.",
  "Briefly he skimmed the algorithms—some other postgrad had put it all together, he was sure everything was fine—and scribbled at the top: Looks good.",
  "Minor corrections, see below.",
  "Can continue.",
  "",
  "Then he trudged back to the department, dropped the draft in Professor Grimes’s tray, and left without thinking twice.",
  "",
  "As soon as he reached the department the next morning, he knew.",
  "Police cars and fire trucks were parked all round the front entrance.",
  "Caution tape covered the doors and windows; an officer stood by the front door, warding off anyone who tried to get in.",
  "Peter stood among the crowd, heart pounding as he watched uniformed figures emerge from inside.",
  "Two med techs came out bearing an empty stretcher.",
  "",
  "“There’s no point,” he heard an EMT say.",
  "“We’d need a bucket.”",
  "",
  "By then the whole department was gathered outside.",
  "Their whispering grew frantic; voices swelled, theories flew as they counted who was among them and who wasn’t.",
  "A gaggle of undergraduates were so distressed they’d started crying.",
  "“Who’s in charge here?”",
  "Helen Murray kept shouting.",
  "“What’s going on?",
  "Can’t someone tell us what’s happened?”",
  "",
  "Peter pushed his way back through the crowd, stumbled home, and threw up all over his sink.",
  "",
  "Several solutions crossed his mind that night.",
  "",
  "He did consider killing himself.",
  "He spun out all the scenarios in his head.",
  "Hanging, ovens, cyanide apples—what demanded the least amount of effort?",
  "Probably the oven, except the graduate cottage only had a shared oven and it was too low to the ground for him to get his head comfortably inside.",
  "Yes, that was his excuse.",
  "I am too tall to comfortably kill myself.",
  "He also considered turning himself in, confessing his deeds, and letting the Royal Academy of Magick punish him as they pleased—which would be akin to killing himself, since if he couldn’t do magick than he might as well be dead.",
  "But dying seemed so unpleasant, and in any case he couldn’t put his parents through that kind of grief.",
  "",
  "Anyhow it seemed the most obvious—and most difficult—way to put things right would be to retrieve Professor Grimes’s soul from the underworld.",
  "And hadn’t Peter always been motivated by doing the hardest possible thing?",
  "",
  "Still, planning his sojourn took him longer than he thought.",
  "The formula for exchange was the easy part—the Alchemists had found it a long time ago; it was only rarely ever used because no one wanted to pay the price.",
  "The gateway to Hell was harder.",
  "He had the basic idea, but certain texts containing the details he wanted to cross-check kept disappearing from the library.",
  "Some ghost seemed to haunt the archives, always one step ahead of him.",
  "",
  "One night he came into the lab just as Alice was departing.",
  "She bumped his arm on the way out, but she said not a word.",
  "In fact she hardly seemed to register his presence at all; she only cast him a wide-eyed look that was not looking, then hurried down the hallway wobbling under the weight of books balanced in her arms.",
  "Chalk was smeared all over her hands and face.",

  "Baginya dunia akademis adalah taman bermain, bukan medan perang, dan ia sangat pandai dalam semua permainannya.",
  "",
  "Namun ini membuatnya berbahaya dengan caranya sendiri.",
  "Karena Peter menjalani hidup dengan santai berasumsi segala sesuatu akan berjalan semestinya tepat seperti yang ia butuhkan, karena dalam banyak hal, memang selalu begitu.",
  "Ini membuatnya ceroboh.",
  "Ia tidak pernah terlalu memikirkan konsekuensinya, atau tentang banyak hal secara khusus kecuali penelitiannya sendiri.",
  "Dan hanya ketika segalanya menjadi kacau, ketika keadaan menjadi tidak terkendali, ketika efek domino dari keinginannya mengalir deras jauh melampaui apa pun yang ia harapkan atau inginkan—baru saat itulah ia menyadari betapa berbahayanya kecerobohan itu.",
  "",
  "Peter berusia lima tahun ketika kejeniusannya menjadi nyata.",
  "Ia terbaring sakit di rumah, dan tidak kunjung sembuh secepat yang diharapkan, dan orang tuanya menganggap perlu menyewa seorang guru les matematika di rumah agar Peter tidak ketinggalan.",
  "Tutor ini—salah satu mahasiswa bimbingan ayahnya, yang akan dengan senang hati melakukan apa saja selain ini jika tidak butuh uang saku—mengambil pendekatan yang tidak bertanggung jawab secara pedagogis dengan memberinya satu latihan aljabar pada satu waktu sambil teralihkan oleh tumpukan tugasnya sendiri yang harus dinilai.",
  "",
  "Peter dengan senang hati menyelesaikan soal-soal itu.",
  "Dan karena ia tidak berada di ruang kelas yang penuh dengan anak-anak yang berceloteh riang soal krayon, dan karena semua perhatiannya tidak tercurah untuk tidak menarik perhatian, ia membiarkan dirinya melaju melewati pelajaran berikutnya, dan berikutnya lagi.",
  "Cara Peter melihatnya, ia hanya dengan senang hati menyelesaikan soal berikutnya yang muncul.",
  "Ia tidak memperhatikan rahang gurunya yang ternganga selama satu jam itu.",

  "“Dia tidak pantas berada di kelas satu, Anda harus mengeluarkannya dari sana.”",

  "Orang tua Peter—ayahnya seorang matematikawan, ibunya seorang ahli biologi—sangat gembira dengan berita ini; karena semua orang tua akademisi berharap dan berekspektasi memiliki anak-anak pintar tetapi tidak berani mengakui secara terbuka bahwa mereka menginginkan anak-anak jenius.",
  "Tapi tampaknya Peter memang jenius, jadi mereka mengatur agar ia dikelilingi oleh guru les sepanjang waktu, merangsang otaknya dengan studi tingkat lanjut.",
  "",
  "Ini adalah hal yang baik, karena jika tidak, masa kecil Peter akan berlalu dalam kesunyian yang membosankan.",
  "Karena ciri khas lain tentang Peter adalah ia begitu sering sakit.",
  "Awalnya ia tampak seperti anak yang rewel biasa, selalu bermasalah dengan sakit perut atau keracunan makanan atau diare atau sembelit.",
  "Nanti juga sembuh seiring bertambahnya usia, kata kakek-neneknya; beberapa anak memang suka tertular setiap kuman di udara.",
  "Namun, pada saat ia berusia enam tahun, menjadi jelas bahwa apa pun yang diderita Peter adalah parah dan kronis.",
  "Penelitian medis tentang penyakit radang usus akan berkembang pesat selama masa hidup Peter.",
  "Tapi di masa kecilnya, hal paling jauh yang bisa dikatakan dokter mana pun kepada keluarganya adalah bahwa usus besarnya tampaknya meradang tanpa alasan yang jelas, dan bahwa ia sebaiknya menghindari tepung terigu.",
  "Ini kemudian meluas hingga mencakup produk susu, kacang-kacangan, dan sayuran mentah—memang, Peter menghabiskan banyak waktu untuk diet eliminasi.",
  "Mereka tidak tahu apakah semua itu membantu, hanya saja diet serba cair—yaitu, kaldu tulang dan jus apel—tampaknya memperbaiki keadaan saat ia berada di kondisi terburuknya, tetapi hanya karena itu berarti tidak ada yang tersisa di ususnya untuk dibersihkan.",
  "",
  "Akhirnya, setelah banyak kunjungan spesialis dan salah diagnosis, ia didiagnosis menderita penyakit Crohn—penyakit radang usus kronis tanpa penyebab yang diketahui dan tanpa obat.",
  "Peter dan orang tuanya mulai menyebut kondisinya sebagai Sang Monster.",
  "Mempersonifikasikan penyakit itu membantu, karena jika tidak, itu hanyalah sesuatu yang misterius yang mengacaukan kesadarannya akan diri sendiri.",
  "Sistem kekebalan tubuhnya sendiri menyerang sel-selnya sendiri tanpa alasan yang jelas.",
  "Lebih mudah menganggapnya sebagai entitas asing yang berubah-ubah.",
  "Terkadang Sang Monster membiarkannya sendiri.",
  "Terkadang ia menggerogoti bagian dalam tubuhnya tanpa henti.",

  "Berat badannya sangat kurang, dan karena pengobatan pertama untuk Crohn yang kambuh adalah imunosupresan, ia juga terus-menerus menderita penyakit musiman apa pun yang sedang beredar.",
  "Tidak pernah ada waktu ketika Peter tidak batuk atau pilek atau muntah; memang, jika hari langka itu tiba ketika ia tampak sehat, orang tuanya hanya akan bersiap-siap menghadapi kekambuhan yang ganas.",

  "Peter menerima semua ini dengan lapang dada.",
  "Ia tidak punya saudara kandung atau teman di lingkungan rumahnya; ia tidak memiliki “masa kecil yang normal” sebagai pembanding.",
  "Kesehatan yang buruk hanyalah sesuatu yang harus ia hadapi.",

  "Malam itu ia mendengarkan orang tuanya bertengkar di balik pintu tertutup.",
  "Dia benar, kata ayahnya; dia itu unggul, tidak ada alasan untuk menahannya.",
  "Tapi dia menjadi dingin, kata ibunya.",
  "Pikiran-pikiran inferior, istilah macam apa itu, dari mana dia memungutnya?",
  "Kita tidak bisa membiarkannya tumbuh dengan berpikir dia lebih baik dari orang lain.",
  "",
  "Tidak apa-apa, pikir Peter.",
  "Biarkan mereka menganggapnya dingin, kasar, antisosial.",
  "Tumbuh dengan penyakit kronis berarti memilih antara yang buruk dan yang lebih buruk, dan Peter telah memutuskan hari itu bahwa apa pun yang terjadi, ia tidak akan pernah lagi menjadi obyek belas kasihan.",
  "",
  "Pada saat Peter mengambil ujian A-levels, dokter akhirnya menemukan rangkaian obat yang tampaknya bekerja lebih baik daripada yang lain.",
  "Namanya mercaptopurine, dan obat itu mengganggu sintesis DNA sehingga sel-sel yang meradang tidak dapat dengan mudah membelah diri.",
  "Ini memiliki efek samping yang tidak menguntungkan yaitu menekan seluruh sistem kekebalan tubuhnya, yang berarti Peter harus mencuci tangannya secara obsesif dan menghindari keramaian selama musim flu musim dingin.",
  "Tetapi di luar itu ia bisa makan semua makanan yang sama, dan melakukan semua hal yang sama, seperti orang lain seusianya.",
  "Jadi tiga minggu setelah ulang tahunnya yang ketujuh belas, ia pun pergi, membawa dua koper, ke universitas yang sama tempat orang tuanya bertemu dan jatuh cinta.",
  "",
  "Peter berkembang pesat di Oxford.",
  "Mata kuliahnya membuatnya terpesona; para tutornya memujanya.",
  "Ia mencoba sampanye untuk pertama kalinya.",
  "Ia mengendarai sepeda untuk pertama kalinya.",
  "Satu minggu di semester pertamanya ia menghadiri kuliah umum tentang paradoks dasar dalam sihir dan jatuh cinta pada bidang itu; pada sifatnya yang tak terduga, ketidakterbatasannya.",
  "Sebelumnya, ia berencana masuk matematika atau fisika.",
  "Tetapi sihir, tampaknya, adalah gunung es besar yang puncaknya baru terlihat sekilas oleh mereka, dan ia sangat senang mengetahui betapa banyak lagi yang tersisa untuk ditemukan.",
  "Pada tahun-tahun itu, orang-orang menerbitkan penemuan-penemuan inovatif setiap hari.",
  "Mereka baru saja memulai investigasi di Carne Abbas.",
  "Mereka baru saja menemukan endapan kapur di Agora.",
  "Mereka baru saja menemukan dasar-dasar sihir yang menyokong sejarah dunia kuno, dan di sinilah ia berada di pusatnya.",
  "Terkadang ia berjalan-jalan di sekitar kampus tanpa tujuan sama sekali, begitu pusing karena kegembiraan sehingga ia tidak bisa tidur.",
  "",
  "Juga menjadi jelas baginya selama waktu ini bahwa ia telah menjadi apa yang oleh sebagian orang disebut menarik.",
  "Sungguh menakjubkan ia tumbuh setinggi itu, karena ia menghabiskan sebagian besar masa kecilnya di persentil terbawah untuk berat badannya.",
  "Tetapi ketika pubertas tiba, rasanya seperti dewa penipu menarik kepala dan pergelangan kakinya dan merentangkannya seperti Silly Putty, sampai ia menjadi semacam kumpulan rambut lemas dan anggota tubuh kurus kering yang tak bisa dikenali—ramuan yang, ketika kau memasukkannya ke dalam setelan jas dan dasi, cukup disukai oleh para pemuda dan pemudi Oxford.",
  "Proporsi tubuhnya membuatnya pandai mendayung, dan begitu ia mulai mendayung, ia menyadari banyak sekali hal baru yang menyenangkan tentang tubuhnya.",
  "Lengannya menjadi kuat, dadanya terisi, dan ia belajar mengoleskan sedikit saja gel di rambutnya agar setengah berdiri.",

  "",
  "Semua ini untuk mengatakan, Peter menjadi sedikit konyol selama tahun-tahun di Oxford itu.",
  "",
  "Remisinya tidak sempurna.",
  "Sang Monster masih datang setiap beberapa bulan, dan ini berarti menginap di rumah sakit, steroid infus, dan istirahat di tempat tidur.",
  "Tetapi tidak ada yang peduli, Peter belajar, selama ia tidak memberi tahu siapa pun apa masalahnya, selama ia membiarkan mereka mengisi kekosongan itu dengan dugaan mereka sendiri.",

  "Tidak sekali pun ia mengatakan sedang tidak enak badan; ia hanya menolak membuat alasan sama sekali.",
  "Ia mendapati ia bisa lolos dengan semakin banyak hal.",
  "Ia bisa bolos kelas berhari-hari.",
  "Bahkan berminggu-minggu, meskipun ia berusaha untuk tidak berlebihan.",
  "Ia memang berusaha untuk tidak pernah tinggal di rumah kecuali ia terbaring di tempat tidur.",
  "Tidak ada yang pernah mengeluh; jika ada, teman-teman dan tutornya menerima semuanya dengan santai.",
  "Oh, kata mereka; begitulah Murdoch.",
  "Melakukan apa pun yang ia mau, anak yang gila.",
  "Jadi selama tiga tahun di Oxford, ia mengembangkan reputasi ini—seorang jenius yang pelupa dan tidak menentu.",
  "",
  "Mungkin ia sengaja melakukannya.",
  "Mungkin ia terkadang bersikap pura-pura—ia akan berbicara tentang solusi soal-soal latihan dengan suara melamun dan acuh tak acuh seolah-olah ia tidak menghabiskan waktu berjam-jam mengerjakannya, atau berpura-pura belum membaca padahal sebenarnya ia begadang semalaman.",
  "Jika ia harus meninggalkan kelas ke kamar mandi, ia mengaku akan pergi merokok.",
  "Dan jika ia harus menginap di rumah sakit lebih dari seminggu, ia berpura-pura telah kabur ke Barcelona atau Göttingen—ini terkadang benar, karena orang tuanya suka menghadiri konferensi dan ia suka menemani mereka—atau hanya tinggal di rumah dan tidur, karena ia ingin, karena Peter Murdoch tidak perlu menghadiri kuliah untuk lulus dengan nilai sempurna.",

  "",
  "Ia tercengang betapa baiknya cara ini bekerja.",
  "Tidak ada yang membencinya karena ketidakhadirannya; mereka justru semakin bersemangat ketika ia muncul.",
  "Murdoch adalah kehadiran yang langka; kemunculannya adalah anugerah.",
  "Di dunia yang ditentukan oleh persepsi, Peter sekarang belajar membangun kedok yang paling meyakinkan.",
  "Para jenius bisa dimaafkan atas keanehan apa pun.",
  "Mereka akan memaafkan tubuh yang sakit-sakitan, Peter memutuskan, selama mereka terintimidasi oleh pikirannya.",
  "Dan oh, pikiran hebat macam apa yang akan ia miliki.",
  "",
  "Ketika tiba waktunya untuk membahas masa depannya, Peter telah memutuskan dengan mantap untuk mengambil PhD dalam sihir analitik.",
  "Matematika dan fisika menghiburnya, tetapi ia tergoda oleh sesuatu yang tidak diketahui yang licin; cara bergulat dengan kebenaran dalam sihir terasa seperti mencoba menggenggam sinar matahari di telapak tangan.",

  "Nah, ini akan menjadikan Cambridge pilihan yang jelas, seandainya saja orang tuanya tidak keberatan.",
  "Aoife dan Howard Murdoch mengambil gelar doktor di Oxford, yang dalam pandangan mereka adalah institusi terhebat di bumi.",
  "Mereka juga memiliki koneksi yang kuat di lingkaran sosial akademisi Inggris, jadi tentu saja mereka mendengar desas-desus itu.",
  "",
  "“Pria itu kasar,” kata ibunya.",
  "“Lagi pula, tidakkah kau akan lebih bahagia di tempat yang... lebih nyaman?",

  "Kenapa tidak tinggal di Oxford?”",
  "",
  "“Atau bahkan Dunia Baru,” kata ayahnya, yang masih bersikeras menyebutnya sebagai Dunia Baru sebagai lelucon, meskipun tidak ada yang pernah tertawa.",
  "“Mereka melakukan hal-hal yang cukup inovatif akhir-akhir ini, kau akan bersenang-senang di sana.",

  "Kenapa mengacaukan tahun-tahun terbaikmu di Cambridge?”",
  "",
  "Apa yang tidak mereka berdua katakan dengan lantang: Apa kau yakin bisa menahannya?",
  "",
  "Tapi Peter, sejak kecil, telah beroperasi dengan dua prinsip yang saling terkait.",
  "",
  "Pertama, ia hanya tertarik melakukan hal tersulit yang mungkin.",
  "Dia adalah seorang Nietzschean dalam hal ini.",
  "Bukan dalam artian Übermensch yang aneh dan antisosial, yang dianut oleh begitu banyak pemuda di Oxford.",

  "Dia adalah seorang Nietzschean dalam arti yang lebih luas bahwa ia merasa hidup hanya memiliki tujuan jika ia terus-menerus mendorong dirinya melampaui batasnya sendiri.",
  "Ia percaya hanya fakultas di Cambridge yang bisa membantunya mencapai batasnya.",
  "Dan ia tidak akan membuang waktunya melakukan apa pun selain pekerjaan terbaiknya.",
  "",
  "Kedua, ia benci membuat pengecualian karena kondisi tubuhnya.",
  "Peter telah menghabiskan seluruh hidupnya menjadi bocah Murdoch yang sakit-sakitan.",
  "Ia telah diberi tahu sejak kecil, biasanya oleh guru-guru yang bermaksud baik dan simpatik, bahwa tidak apa-apa jika ia tidak ikut permainan ini, jika ia tidak ikut karyawisata ini, jika ia tidak bisa mengikuti ujian, jika ia tidak mau berlari di putaran terakhir.",

  "Peter sudah muak dengan orang lain yang mengasihaninya.",
  "Ia tidak tertarik hanya untuk mengimbangi orang lain; dalam melakukan apa yang bisa dilakukan oleh seseorang tanpa Crohn.",
  "Ia ingin melakukan apa yang tidak bisa dilakukan oleh orang tanpa Crohn.",
  "Jadi ketika ia mendengar cerita-cerita horor—asisten lab yang berhenti, mahasiswa pascasarjana yang secara teratur keluar dari kantor Grimes sambil menangis—Peter menganggapnya sebagai tantangan.",
  "",
  "Nah, mungkin waktunya di Oxford membuatnya terlalu percaya diri dengan pesonanya sendiri.",
  "Mungkin rekan-rekan dan profesornya terlalu memujinya; mungkin egonya telah tumbuh sedikit lebih besar dari yang baik untuknya.",
  "Tetapi Peter tidak berpikir ia salah percaya bahwa ia adalah sesuatu yang istimewa—dan bahwa jika ada yang bisa mengesankan Jacob Grimes, itu adalah dia.",
  "",
  "Cambridge!",
  "Peter langsung menyukainya; gang-gang berbatu, sungai yang berkelok-kelok, tepian yang hijau dan damai.",

  "Ia sudah puas dengan dunia kelab malam saat sarjana—beberapa semester yang tidak menyenangkan di Wetherspoons sudah cukup—dan sekarang ia menghargai ketenangan Cambridge.",
  "Selalu ada terlalu banyak hal yang terjadi di Oxford.",
  "Cambridge, di daerah rawa, tampak seperti tempat di mana kau bisa fokus dan menyelesaikan sesuatu.",
  "Anak-anak yang mengincar Westminster semua belajar politik, filsafat, dan ekonomi di tempat lain; di sini, di Cambridge, para ilmuwan datang untuk bermimpi.",
  "Departemen Sihir Analitik juga, adalah semua yang dijanjikan padanya—fakultas yang brilian, teman sekelas yang brilian, dan anggaran kapur yang tak terbatas.",
  "Profesor Grimes sangat menuntut dan tangguh, seperti yang diharapkan Peter; di bawah bimbingannya Peter merasa pikirannya diasah, pisau yang digesek tajam ke batu asah.",
  "",
  "Dan ada Alice.",
  "",
  "Alice Law.",
  "Berapa malam selama tahun pertama itu ia bersepeda pulang jauh lewat tengah malam, pusing karena ingatan akan tawanya?",
  "Peter belum pernah mengenal orang seperti dia—Alice yang ketus, keras kepala, konyol.",

  "Dia memiliki kegigihan seorang yang tidak diunggulkan, kreativitas seorang seniman, dan yang terpenting, dia berpikir sangat berbeda dari semua orang yang pernah berlatih bersamanya di Oxford.",

  "Mungkin itu pengaruh Amerika (Peter belum pernah ke Amerika tetapi ayahnya telah membuatnya percaya bahwa itu adalah tanah para ikonoklas), atau mungkin itu adalah kepekaan Alice yang tidak biasa, tetapi sesuatu tentang pikirannya—yah, risomatik adalah cara terbaik ia bisa menggambarkannya.",
  "Dia tidak berpikir dalam garis lurus; dia selalu berkelok-kelok ke luar.",
  "Dia selalu bertanya-tanya bagaimana disiplin ilmu yang tidak terkait bisa saling berbicara, atau mengorek hal-hal acak dari arsip yang belum pernah didengar siapa pun.",
  "Bisakah kau bayangkan dunia tanpa ingatan?",
  "tanyanya.",
  "Bisakah kita membentuk hubungan yang bermakna jika kita memiliki ingatan ikan mas?",
  "Apakah hewan peliharaanmu tahu bahwa mereka suatu hari akan mati?",
  "Apakah teleportasi sama dengan kematian?",
  "Sekarang anggaplah kau berpikir teleportasi adalah kematian—jika kau bangun, dan pasanganmu mengaku telah berteleportasi dari satu sisi tempat tidur ke sisi lain, apakah kau akan meratapi mereka?",
  "Belum pernah sebelumnya ia bertemu dengan seorang pemikir yang pikirannya berputar ke tempat-tempat yang tidak bisa ia ikuti dengan mudah.",
  "Ia sangat suka melihatnya berpikir keras, mendengar pikirannya yang terfragmentasi berputar menjadi argumen lengkap, melihat matanya melesat ke titik di ruang yang tidak bisa ia lihat.",
  "",
  "Bukan hanya karena dia brilian.",
  "Semua orang di sekitarnya brilian; kecemerlangan di sini membosankan.",
  "Alice adalah sebuah tantangan.",
  "Alice membuatnya tetap waspada.",
  "Hati-hati dengan yang satu itu, Profesor Grimes memberitahunya sambil minum teh di klub fakultas.",

  "Dia akan gagal di awal, atau dia akan memenangkan Nobel.”",
  "",
  "Ya, Peter sering memperhatikan Alice.",
  "Di malam hari ia memimpikan siluet seperti burung yang berjingkat di depan papan tulis.",
  "Kepala dimiringkan, mempertimbangkan.",
  "",
  "Itu semua sangat romantis.",
  "Untuk sesaat Peter Murdoch memiliki semua yang pernah ia harapkan: seorang pembimbing yang menginspirasinya, seorang sahabat yang menantang dan membuatnya bersemangat, dan tubuh yang sangat kooperatif.",
  "Setiap beberapa minggu ia bersepeda ke rumah sakit untuk pemeriksaan dengan ahli gastroenterologinya, meskipun jauh di lubuk hatinya ia mulai curiga ini tidak perlu.",
  "Dia sekarang berada dalam rentang waktu terpanjang yang pernah ia alami tanpa kambuh.",
  "Terkadang, luar biasa, butuh upaya aktif untuk mengingat Sang Monster sama sekali.",
  "",
  "Mereka bilang kau bisa mengalami remisi selama beberapa dekade.",
  "Pamflet informasi Crohn dijejali dengan testimoni oleh orang-orang yang suatu hari bangun tanpa rasa sakit, tanpa kram, dan tidak pernah merasakannya lagi selama bertahun-tahun.",
  "Tidak ada yang tahu apa yang menyebabkan remisi, kata mereka; remisi adalah keajaiban; terkadang tubuhmu memutuskan untuk berhenti menyerang dirinya sendiri.",
  "Sepanjang masa kecilnya Peter tidak pernah membiarkan dirinya berani berharap.",
  "Tetapi seiring berjalannya waktu, semakin masuk akal untuk berharap bahwa inilah saatnya—bahwa ia telah meninggalkan Sang Monster di belakangnya selamanya, dan sekarang ia bisa berlari bebas.",
"",
  "Keadaan berbalik di pertengahan tahun pertamanya.",
  "",
  "Crohn bisa melakukan itu padamu.",
  "Seharusnya ia ingat.",
  "Sang Monster tidak pernah ditaklukkan, hanya diusir ke persembunyian.",
  "Suatu malam ia sedang makan kari pedas dan minum lassi mawar kapulaga di kedai India di seberang jembatan.",
  "Keesokan paginya perutnya mulas karena kram yang khas; meski baru ringan, tapi itu pertanda akan datangnya sesuatu yang lebih buruk.",
  "",
  "Semuanya memburuk dengan sangat cepat.",
  "Ini adalah serangan terburuk yang pernah dialami Peter sejak ia berusia dua belas tahun.",
  "Segalanya berjalan baik begitu lama sehingga ia lupa betapa mengerikannya penyakit itu—landasan kembar berupa diare dan dehidrasi terus-menerus, kram dan wasir, keengganan untuk memasukkan apa pun ke dalam mulutnya karena takut itu hanya akan keluar lagi.",
  "Dalam satu bulan ia pergi empat kali ke rumah sakit; dua kali pertama untuk infus, yang ketiga dan keempat untuk steroid intravena.",
  "Tampaknya ia telah mengembangkan resistansi terhadap mercaptopurine, dan ini berarti rencana perawatannya sekarang terdiri dari melemparkan berbagai hal ke dinding dan melihat apa yang menempel.",
  "Berat badannya anjlok.",
  "Kulitnya berubah pucat tembus pandang; ketika ia bercermin, ia bisa melihat pembuluh darahnya, biru dan tipis, melayang di baliknya.",
  "",
  "Ia tidak memberi tahu siapa pun.",
  "Ketika kau telah mendapatkan reputasi seperti yang ia miliki, dunia memberimu privasi tertentu.",
  "Semua orang sudah punya teori mereka sendiri tentang Peter Murdoch, jadi, ketika ia mulai bolos dari lab untuk meringkuk di tempat tidur, ketika ia gagal menyerahkan tugas-tugasnya, mereka hanya memperkuat teori-teori itu.",
  "Murdoch tidak mau repot.",
  "Murdoch tidak peduli.",
  "",
  "Niat baik orang-orang padanya mulai habis.",

  "",
  "Tapi apa pun lebih baik daripada terlihat rentan.",
  "Dalam imajinasi Peter, saat ada yang tahu, saat itulah reputasi Peter yang Agung lenyap, digantikan oleh Peter si Sakit.",
  "Peter si PenyAKITAN.",

  "",
  "Ia tahu ia telah menyakitinya.",
  "Ia melihat tatapan sekilasnya yang terluka.",
  "Ia merasa bersalah atas caranya mengakhiri segalanya.",
  "Belum pernah sebelumnya ia merasa berutang penjelasan kepada siapa pun, karena belum pernah sebelumnya ia menjadi begitu dekat dengan seseorang sehingga kepergiannya yang tiba-tiba dapat memengaruhi hidup mereka.",
  "Sebelumnya, Peter hanya melipir ke latar belakang, keluar dari orbit.",
  "Ia keluar masuk dalam pertemanan, selalu menjadi kenalan yang berharga, tidak pernah menjadi sosok yang konstan.",
  "Di sini Alice telah menjadi sosok yang konstan.",
  "Ia tidak bisa melepaskannya.",
  "",
  "Namun, ingatan tentang Jemma Davies kecil terpatri di benaknya, begitu pula saat yang menakutkan ketika ia tidak bisa lagi membedakan persahabatan dari amal.",
  "Ia pikir ia selalu bisa minta maaf nanti, mencari-cari alasan, memenangkannya kembali.",
  "Tetapi jika mereka ingin berteman lagi, maka Alice tidak boleh tahu.",
  "",
  "Satu-satunya orang yang tidak bisa ia bohongi adalah Profesor Grimes.",
  "Segalanya telah mencapai titik puncaknya—ia terlalu banyak ketinggalan tugas, ia terlalu banyak melewatkan pertemuan.",
  "Mustahil sekarang untuk lolos hanya dengan mengandalkan reputasi.",
  "Pada titik ini ia berisiko kehilangan pendanaannya.",
  "",
  "Jadi Peter pergi ke kantor pembimbingnya, membawa catatan medis, untuk memohon belas kasihan.",

  "“Tapi kau terlihat baik-baik saja,” kata Profesor Grimes, yang pastinya tidak melihat dengan saksama, karena Peter pada saat ini telah kehilangan sembilan kilogram dan bisa menghitung semua tulang rusuknya di cermin.",

  "Maka setidaknya batas-batas kehilangan dan ketidakmampuannya akan jelas.",
  "Kenyataannya, Crohn terkesan sebagai sesuatu yang sepenuhnya, seenaknya, dibuat-buat.",
  "Seekor monster menggerogoti saya sepanjang waktu, tetapi Anda tidak dapat melihatnya.",

  "Pertanyaan tentang bagaimana mengurutkan dan mendeskripsikan dunia berdampak pada hampir setiap bidang lain.",
  "Inovasi Peter ada dalam variasi halus dari Paradoks Russell, di mana himpunan itu sendiri bukanlah anggota dari himpunan yang mereka deskripsikan—artinya sesuatu bisa menjadi normal dan abnormal sekaligus, atau bukan normal maupun abnormal.",

  "Bersalah, bersalah dalam semua hal—ia tidak cukup rajin; ia tidak memenuhi tenggat waktunya; ia tidak berhasil mengatasinya.",
  "Tubuh yang lemah sama saja dengan pikiran yang lemah; keduanya mungkin menimpamu, dan keduanya mendiskualifikasimu dari kejeniusan.",

  "",
  "Ia menyelinap keluar dari kantor, kepala tertunduk.",
  "Lab di luar sunyi; semua orang menatapnya.",
  "Alice bertemu pandangnya; ia melangkah maju, seolah ingin berbicara.",
  "Tetapi pandangan Peter telah menyempit menjadi setitik cahaya di sekitar pintu, dan ia melewatinya seolah-olah perempuan itu tidak ada di sana.",
  "",
  "Peter hanya bisa menghubungkan apa yang ia lakukan selanjutnya dengan harga diri kekanak-kanakan.",
  "",
  "Sudah jatuh tertimpa tangga pula, Profesor Grimes meminta Peter untuk menyumbangkan pembuktian ke draf akhir.",
  "Sebagian dari setiap publikasi perlu melibatkan dokumentasi pengulangan berganda dari setiap komponen pentagram sebelum kau dapat mengaktifkannya dengan subjek manusia, dan kemudian dokumentasi pengulangan berganda dari semua iterasi berbasis manusia.",
  "Ini berarti Peter harus memeriksa ulang penelitiannya sendiri yang dicuri dengan pena merah, dan melaporkan kembali semua kesalahan yang mungkin ia abaikan.",
  "Tentu saja Peter setuju; tidak ada yang bisa menolak permintaan langsung dari Profesor Grimes dan tetap mempertahankan pendanaan mereka.",
  "Tetapi ini tidak berarti ia harus melakukannya dengan baik.",

  "",
  "Ia bersumpah demi Tuhan—ia tidak pernah bermaksud menyakiti siapa pun.",
  "Pikiran paling jahat yang pernah ia miliki adalah bahwa mungkin akan menyenangkan untuk mempermalukan sang profesor.",
  "Ia tahu Grimes tidak memeriksa ulang pekerjaannya sendiri; sudah menjadi rahasia umum bahwa Grimes sudah lama ceroboh dalam hal detail, tidak akan pernah menyelesaikan makalah jika bukan karena pasukan asisten yang mencarikan bahan untuknya.",

  "Dalam imajinasi Peter, semua ini memuncak pada semacam rasa malu publik yang besar di konferensi musim panas Royal Academy of Magick mungkin, ketika Profesor Grimes disoraki dan ditertawakan dari panggung karena membuat kesalahan yang akan disadari oleh seorang mahasiswa sarjana.",
  "",
  "Dan sungguh, motivasi dominan Peter hanyalah untuk tidak menghabiskan lebih banyak waktu pada makalah itu daripada yang pantas didapatkan Profesor Grimes.",

  "Kenapa repot-repot, jika ia tidak mendapatkan pengakuan apa pun?",
  "",
  "Jadi ia memeriksa seluruh tumpukan itu dalam satu malam, bersandar di tempat tidur, setengah hati mencoret-coret koreksi di margin.",

  "Ia tidak repot-repot menjiplak ulang setiap iterasi pentagram; itu memakan banyak waktu, dan membutuhkan begitu banyak terjemahan bolak-balik dari bahasa Latin dan Yunani.",
  "Secara singkat ia membaca sekilas algoritma—mahasiswa pascasarjana lain yang menyatukan semuanya, ia yakin semuanya baik-baik saja—dan mencoret-coret di bagian atas: Terlihat bagus.",
  "Koreksi kecil, lihat di bawah.",
  "Bisa dilanjutkan.",
  "",
  "Kemudian ia berjalan dengan susah payah kembali ke departemen, meletakkan draf itu di baki Profesor Grimes, dan pergi tanpa berpikir dua kali.",

  "",
  "Begitu ia sampai di departemen keesokan paginya, ia tahu.",
  "Mobil polisi dan truk pemadam kebakaran diparkir di sekitar pintu masuk depan.",
  "Garis polisi menutupi pintu dan jendela; seorang petugas berdiri di depan pintu depan, menghalau siapa pun yang mencoba masuk.",
  "Peter berdiri di antara kerumunan, jantung berdebar kencang saat ia menyaksikan sosok-sosok berseragam muncul dari dalam.",

  "Sekelompok mahasiswa sarjana begitu tertekan sehingga mereka mulai menangis.",
  "“Siapa yang bertanggung jawab di sini?”",
  "Helen Murray terus berteriak.",
  "“Apa yang terjadi?",
  "Tidak bisakah seseorang memberi tahu kami apa yang telah terjadi?”",
  "",
  "Peter mendorong kembali kerumunan, terhuyung-huyung pulang, dan muntah di wastafelnya.",
  "",
  "Beberapa solusi terlintas di benaknya malam itu.",
  "",
  "Ia memang mempertimbangkan untuk bunuh diri.",
  "Ia memutar semua skenario di kepalanya.",
  "Gantung diri, oven, apel sianida—mana yang membutuhkan sedikit usaha?",
  "Mungkin oven, kecuali pondok pascasarjana hanya memiliki oven bersama dan letaknya terlalu rendah ke tanah untuk memasukkan kepalanya dengan nyaman.",
  "Ya, itu alasannya.",
  "Saya terlalu tinggi untuk bunuh diri dengan nyaman.",
  "Ia juga mempertimbangkan untuk menyerahkan diri, mengakui perbuatannya, dan membiarkan Royal Academy of Magick menghukumnya sesuka mereka—yang sama saja dengan bunuh diri, karena jika ia tidak bisa melakukan sihir maka ia lebih baik mati.",
  "Tetapi mati tampak begitu tidak menyenangkan, dan lagi pula ia tidak bisa membuat orang tuanya menanggung kesedihan seperti itu.",
  "",
  "Bagaimanapun, tampaknya cara yang paling jelas—dan paling sulit—untuk memperbaiki keadaan adalah dengan mengambil kembali jiwa Profesor Grimes dari dunia bawah.",
  "Dan bukankah Peter selalu termotivasi untuk melakukan hal tersulit?",
  "",
  "Tetap saja, merencanakan perjalanannya memakan waktu lebih lama dari yang ia kira.",
  "Formula untuk pertukaran adalah bagian yang mudah—para Alkemis telah menemukannya sejak lama; itu hanya jarang digunakan karena tidak ada yang mau membayar harganya.",
  "Gerbang menuju Neraka lebih sulit.",
  "Ia punya ide dasarnya, tetapi teks-teks tertentu yang berisi detail yang ingin ia periksa silang terus menghilang dari perpustakaan.",
  "Semacam hantu tampak menghantui arsip, selalu selangkah lebih maju darinya.",
  "",
  "Suatu malam ia masuk ke lab tepat saat Alice akan pergi.",
  "Perempuan itu menyenggol lengannya saat keluar, tetapi ia tidak mengucapkan sepatah kata pun.",
  "Faktanya, ia sepertinya tidak menyadari kehadirannya sama sekali; ia hanya memberinya tatapan mata terbelalak yang tidak melihat, lalu bergegas ke lorong terhuyung-huyung di bawah tumpukan buku yang seimbang di lengannya.",
  "Kapur berlesotan di seluruh tangan dan wajahnya.",
  "Dan di papan tulis yang dihapus dengan tergesa-gesa di belakangnya, Peter bisa melihat jejak penjumlahan yang baru-baru ini ia kenali dengan baik.",
  "Ia mengenali semuanya dalam sekejap.",
  "",
  "Penjumlahan Ramanujan.",
  "Modifikasi Setiya.",

  "Their situation in the Escher trap was just a microcosm of their entire lives at Cambridge: endless scribbling in an attempt to prove they could be the golden exception when in truth there was nothing exceptional about them at all; they were only following the scripts laid out for them from the beginning.",

                  "Alice slept.",
  "She dreamed, and lost herself in the specificity of memory: a spoon clinking against a teacup, driblets spilling out the sides that deepened to blood-red; the teacup became a bladder pouch, and the spoon a knife of bone.",
  "Helen Murray's voice; white teeth, lipstick too bright, smeared over dry skin.",
  "What do you want, Alice? Did you think you were the first?",
  "Alice in a graveyard, dirt beneath her nails; a shovel in her hands, an ache in her back.",
  "Professor Grimes, or at least the pieces she'd found of him; an eye, a lip, a fragment of a nose; all the little pieces on a sheet of wax paper, lined up against a poor pencil sketch; and a nail through his forehead, just to keep it all in place; all the scribbled recordings of the Thessalian witch.",
  "The living face imposed over the revived pieces.",
  "Those shredded lips moved.",
  "Good morning, he said.",
  "",
  "Alice awoke.",
  "",
  "A Shade knelt over her; all silvery smoke, his face very close to her own.",
  "She jolted upright.",
  "",
  "They regarded each other.",
  "The Shade had such a slippery face, features lapsing and shifting, as if he couldn't decide himself what he looked like.",
  "If Alice had been pressed to describe him, the best analogy she could have come up with was a grayscale mugshot.",
  "Nondescript, fugitive.",
  "He looked at her with what Alice could only think of as a wide-eyed hunger, not destructive, but longing, as if he wanted to take her in with all of his senses.",
  "The look of her, the smell of her.",
  "",
  "Still—and this was her foggy, starved head thinking—he didn't seem dangerous.",
  "At least he was not warped with that singular meanness of the Shades in Greed, or the suffocating howl of Wrath.",
  "He seemed more human than any of them, more in control of his appetites anyhow.",
  "If this Shade was going to hurt her, she supposed he would have done it while she was asleep, and for this reason she sat still where she was.",
  "",
  "“Who are you?”",
  "",
  "“I'm Alice,” she whispered. “Alice Law.”",
  "",
  "“You're one of the living.” His voice was like gravel, like earth shifting.",
  "",
  "She didn't see the point in pretending. “Yes.”",
  "",
  "His eyes flickered up and down the chalk stains on her sweater. “You're a magician.”",
  "",
  "“Yes.”",
  "",
  "He burst into laughter.",
  "",
  "“Heavens,” he said. “I have been waiting, and waiting, and now here you are.”",
  "",
  "This Alice found vaguely threatening.",
  "She pulled herself to her feet, and immediately regretted it; a wave of vertigo hit and she swayed, her vision pulsing black.",
  "",
  "The Shade put his hands up. “I won't hurt you.”",
  "",
  "“What do you want?”",
  "",
  "“Only to speak.” The Shade veered forward, until once again he was inches away.",
  "He seemed to have no conception of personal boundaries.",
  "No matter how she shifted his face loomed close to hers, as if he were about to lick or kiss her. “But you, of the living—what are you doing here, all alone in Hell?”",
  "",
  "What indeed was she doing?",
  "Still she had no answer, and she did not think this Shade needed to hear of her regrets. “I'm looking for someone.”",
  "",
  "“Where might that someone be?”",
  "",
  "“I don't know.” She sighed. “I've searched Upper Hell. I have wandered Wrath, Cruelty, Violence, and Tyranny. I never found him, and I have reason to suspect his sins were not so light.”",
  "",
  "“You think he is in Dis.”",
  "",
  "“I—yes, that's right.” Alice had been certain the city was real; all the reliable archives agreed so; but it startled her to hear its name confirmed from the mouth of the dead.",
  "So it was there, so it was waiting. “He must be.”",
  "",
  "“And you need to find the gates.”",
  "",
  "I have a guide, Alice wished to say, but she saw now Archimedes had absconded; she was again on her own. “I suppose.”",
  "",
  "“Come on, then.” The Shade nodded toward the horizon. “I'll show you. Safe passage.”",
  "",
  "“What for?”",
  "",
  "“What do you mean, what for?”",
  "",
  "“I don't mean to offend.” Alice thought of George Edward Moore, mad for a chum.",
  "She thought of the Weaver Girl's girlish laughter.",
  "She thought of Elspeth, righteous and vengeful. “Only we—I haven't had a wonderful time here. And we are in Lower Hell. Everyone wants something.”",
  "",
  "Again the Shade rumbled with laughter.",
  "He turned his eyes back on her, and this time they became the most solid things about him; deep stone, hollows of time. “A story for a song,” he said. “That's all. You want to know of Dis. I want to know of life.”",
  "",
  "So here she was in the deepest circles of Hell on a brisk stroll with a Shade whose sins she did not know.",
  "",
  "Alice couldn't determine if she was very lucky or very foolish.",
  "At least this Shade—he introduced himself as John Gradus, which seemed an obvious lie—did not pretend to be her friend.",
  "His desires were quite clear.",
  "He badgered her for information on the world as she knew it.",
  "He was not at all interested in political or historical developments.",
  "She tried to tell him about the Soviet Union, and he waved a hand in impatience.",
  "Instead he wanted accounts of what brands of chalk were now in vogue (“Shropley's? They haven't gone bankrupt?”), what kinds of foods were then served at dining halls (“Still the same mashed potatoes? Does the Yorkshire pudding still taste like cardboard?”), and how girls' fashion evolved on campus (Alice felt a bit icky describing this one, but Gradus seemed satisfied with a mumbled answer about skirts and stockings.",
  "How short? She didn't recall.",
  "Above the knees? Well, sometimes.",
  "Not in college, but sometimes.)",
  "She didn't mind the interrogations.",
  "Here her memory came in handy, and she needed only close her eyes, summon photographs to her mind, and recount the details as they walked.",
  "",
  "“The London skyline?”",
  "",
  "“There's been a lot of new construction. They've got this big ugly thing, the NatWest tower, sticks straight into the air like a blunt.”",
  "",
  "“The music?”",
  "",
  "She recalled the window of a record store and told him all the names she had seen there. “Judas Priest. Soup Dragons. Iron Maiden. Talking Heads.”",
  "",
  "“What kind of music is that?”",
  "",
  "“Sort of like . . . indie punk, rock, that kind of thing? As in, the opposite of Dusty Springfield?”",
  "",
  "She could not tell if these names made any sense to John Gradus.",
  "He asked, “Do you like them?”",
  "",
  "“They're a little loud,” she said. “But I'm not very adventurous. I just like the Beatles. And Bach.”",
  "",
  "“Pretentious,” he said. “The last meal you had?”",
  "",
  "“Lembas Bread.”",
  "",
  "“No, I mean before.”",
  "",
  "“Oh.” Alice rifled through her mind. “Um. Tea and a toastie.”",
  "",
  "“What kind?”",
  "",
  "“Cheese. Cheddar, I think.”",
  "",
  "“Warmed up?”",
  "",
  "“No, cold.” She saw the plastic wrapping in her mind, the generic logo.",
  "Late-night offerings from a buttery about to close. “It didn't taste very good.”",
  "",
  "“A cold toastie,” he muttered. “All the time in the world, and a cold, congealed toastie.”",
  "",
  "He hungered for the tangible, the material.",
  "He became resentful when he felt she had wasted her time above.",
  "Most of all he was irritated about missed gastronomic opportunities.",
  "He seemed unable to understand why Alice did not eat three-course, gourmet meals every day.",
  "The answer “I wasn't hungry” made no sense to him.",
  "He got such a beady, famished look while Alice spoke that sometimes she felt uneasy; she felt he was siphoning something from her, though she couldn't put her finger on what.",
  "Living force, it felt like.",
  "Perhaps when they were done he would be close to alive, and she would be a rumbling mass of gray.",
  "Disturbing as this was, it was this naked exploitation that, in turn, let her take him at his word.",
  "It could be this easy.",
  "It could be the case he truly was taking her to the gates of Dis.",
  "",
  "She glanced sideways at him as they walked, trying to make out the face of her guide.",
  "Her own Virgil.",
  "She wondered if she could recognize him, if his story was one of the many rumors that haunted the academy.",
  "Was he the demonologist who fed his infant daughter to Azazel?",
  "The cryptologist who sent his students into Faerie without a lifeline?",
  "",
  "Unfortunately Gradus had not put nearly as much effort into maintaining a solid form as Elspeth.",
  "If she focused too hard on his eyes, or on his build, his features slipped and morphed as if they could not decide what they used to be.",
  "Strangely he took the clearest shape when she glimpsed him out of the corner of her eye, when her imagination could supply the rest.",
  "A straight-backed and bespectacled man, the sort who might carry a briefcase, or who might offer you an umbrella when it rained.",
  "A man utterly forgettable.",
  "You saw him on the train, or in the university library, or at the bookstore.",
  "And then he walked out of your life and you forgot all about him; for shapes like him only existed to fill in the background of your own richer world.",
  "Gradus was a man completely without specificity, and Alice suspected he had worked very hard to make this so.",
  "",
  "She tried to place him at least geographically or temporally, because then she could at least rack her memory for mention of any horrendous crimes, say, at Yale in the sixties, but Gradus had been so long in the underworld that he made no references to place himself.",
  "Sometimes she thought she detected vague Nordic undertones in his speech, but otherwise he had that mysterious mid-Atlantic accent that could belong to a Brit who had spent too much time among Americans, or an American who had spent too much time in England.",
  "He was not forthcoming.",
  "She tried once simply asking where he was from, and all he said was, “I'd like to see you guess.”",
  "If anything he seemed to take delight in messing with her.",
  "He would make references to Roosevelt and Churchill, then insinuate he'd personally known Copernicus.",
  "",
  "Once a suspicion struck her, and she asked quickly, so as to catch him off guard, “Jacob?”",
  "",
  "Professor Grimes had always liked his little tests.",
  "",
  "But John Gradus only hmmed and asked, “What's that?”",
  "",
  "No, he couldn't be Professor Grimes.",
  "Professor Grimes hardly cared so much about the world outside his office.",
  "He would never have asked her about Talking Heads.",
  "Fashions changed; Professor Grimes stayed the same.",
  "He lived in a castle in the clouds.",
  "All that mattered was his ideas, and how far they could take him.",
  "",
    "At least John Gradus gave as well as he got, so long as she did not inquire much about personal identity.",
  "On the topic of Hell he was very forthcoming, if not always helpful.",
  "Most of what he said left her with a million more questions.",
  "She asked him what those pieces of writing were, and he explained, \"Why, dissertations, of course. That much should be obvious.\"",
  "",
  "\"Dissertations about what?\"",
  "",
  "\"Whatever we're in for.\"",
  "",
  "\"Does everyone write them?\"",
  "",
  "\"We all must write them.\"",
  "",
  "\"Who reads them?\"",
  "",
  "\"Whoever is in charge. The Furies. Lord Yama himself. Who knows? I've yet to witness anyone read them, mind, but then it's a rare dissertation that passes muster. They say to write until you've done your best work, and when you've done your best work, the ships will come to bring you across the Lethe.\"",
  "",
  "\"What's the point of them?\"",
  "",
  "\"Entertainment, I'm sure. I certainly enjoy reading others' drafts. I came upon a whole stack subtitled My Lolita the other day. Now, that one was really fun!\"",
  "",
  "\"I mean, what makes a good dissertation?\"",
  "",
  "\"Bugger if I know. That's the whole puzzle, isn't it?\"",
  "",
  "She couldn't tell if he was being flippant on purpose or if he truly did not know.",
  "\"Is that how you're being punished, then? You don't get out until you've thoroughly understood your own crime?\"",
  "",
  "\"Some think that.\"",
  "",
  "\"Then how do you pass?\"",
  "",
  "This made Gradus hem and haw.",
  "After a pause he said, \"The only thing anyone knows for sure is that they say you have to tell the truth. That's all.\"",
  "",
  "\"Is it very hard to tell the truth?\"",
  "",
  "\"It must be. Never seen anyone get out.\"",
  "",
  "\"It must drive them crazy,\" Alice mused.",
  "She knew her fair share of dissertating students.",
  "At Cambridge it seemed the standard for a good dissertation was asymptotic.",
  "The closer you got, the more obvious it became that you would never hit the limit.",
  "Eventually what decided things were the restrictions of time—you turned work in on the deadline, perfect or not.",
  "But there were no deadlines in Hell.",
  "You had an eternity for mistakes. \"I bet it's agonizing.\"",
  "",
  "\"Probably,\" said Gradus. \"I don't try.\"",
  "",
  "\"Why not?\"",
  "",
  "\"No more questions,\" he said. \"Our deal is that you entertain me.\"",
  "",
  "\"Oh, fine.\"",
  "",
  "\"What about this man you're looking for? What's he dissertating on?\"",
  "",
  "\"Oh—well, I don't really know.\" Alice paused a moment.",
  "What was the worst sin Professor Grimes had ever committed?",
  "When she put her mind to it, she couldn't come up with anything but the vaguest descriptors, and none of them rang true.",
  "He stole (but for good reason).",
  "He was cruel (with good purpose, to those who deserved it).",
  "\"We both had our theories, but I don't think there's any way to know.\"",
  "",
  "Gradus's voice sharpened, a hook finding purchase. \"You both?\"",
  "",
  "\"Oh,\" said Alice.",
  "",
  "Gradus's footsteps slowed.",
  "His essence billowed out like a pleased, squatting cat. \"Now, this is interesting.\"",
  "",
  "Her pain delighted him.",
  "He kept rubbing his smoky hands together, like a child in glee over a bedtime story.",
  "Then what?",
  "He kept asking this.",
  "Then what?",
  "Then what?",
  "Like a child demanding more sweets, relishing all the droplets of living affect he could wring from her.",
  "She told him about the Weaver Girl but kept vague about Elspeth; she described the bog in Wrath, and the Escher trap, the cuckoo clock, Peter's sacrifice.",
  "The screech of metal.",
  "The Kripkes' delight.",
  "",
  "\"Hold on.\" Gradus stopped walking then.",
  "His aura changed.",
  "The swishy, indifferent whirl of gray stilled to something human—a chill Alice recognized well.",
  "The clammy chill of fear. \"The Kripkes are after you?\"",
  "",
  "\"Why would you be afraid of the Kripkes?\"",
  "",
  "\"They are fiends,\" said Gradus. \"They are the worst things to haunt this land.\"",
  "",
  "\"But you're already dead, you—\" But then Alice remembered Elspeth's words.",
  "I've seen the Kripkes murder a soul. \"Well. I suppose we'd better walk faster.\"",
  "",
  "\"But now this is exciting!\" Gradus spread his hands, palms open.",
  "\"A tragedy, a revenge story, a rescue, a race against time. Will you escape the Kripkes? Or will they hunt you down, before you can finish your fallen comrade's quest?\"",
  "",
  "\"I suppose.\"",
  "",
  "\"What do you mean, you suppose?\"",
  "",
  "\"I mean, that sounds like a fine script.\" Alice felt very tired. \"I suppose I'll follow it.\"",
  "",
  "\"What do you mean, you'll follow it?\" Somehow she had agitated Gradus.",
  "His coat started whipping around both their heels, as if he could encircle her in a vortex of his irritation.",
  "\"Aren't you upset?\" he demanded. \"Aren't you devastated?\"",
  "",
  "\"Sure, Gradus.\"",
  "",
  "\"You sound as if you don't even know what you're doing here.\"",
  "",
  "\"That's just it.\" His frustration was exhausting.",
  "She wanted to swat him away like a fly. \"I don't know. I'm just tired.\"",
  "",
  "\"But don't you care about anything?\"",
  "",
  "\"I suppose I should.\"",
  "",
  "How could she explain to him this numbness?",
  "It wasn't that Alice didn't care, it was that she had cared so much, and a thread had snapped.",
  "Some fundamental capacity was broken.",
  "She felt hurled out of the world of meaning, feeling, attachment.",
  "She couldn't bleed anymore.",
  "She was drained already.",
  "Scripts were all she had now, and they were enough to keep her walking, but not enough for her heart to start beating.",
  "",
  "\"But you're alive,\" said Gradus, as if this were the answer to everything.",
  "",
  "\"Against all my desires. Yes.\"",
  "",
  "Gradus said nothing.",
  "She walked and waited, hoping he would change the subject, but he remained silent.",
  "She sensed she had upset him, but how, she could not say.",
  "Gradus had not seemed the sensitive type.",
  "Until now she'd been comfortable in their callous rapport.",
  "At one point she had insinuated he was Jack the Ripper, and he had only laughed.",
  "",
  "But he asked no more questions.",
  "For the rest of the morning they walked in silence.",
  "Once or twice he muttered to himself, but she could not make out what he said.",
  "She sensed only his resentment, a bitter and hostile wave, as abrupt as it was confusing.",
  "And Alice, well accustomed to placating volatile men, knew only to await her punishment.",
  "",
  "\"So.\" Gradus spoke at last. \"There it is.\"",
  "",
  "For the past hour they had climbed up a steep and rocky hill.",
  "Alice was nearly bent over with exhaustion, hands over her knees.",
  "Her eyes had rarely left the ground in front of her.",
  "Now she lifted her head, straightened up, and gasped.",
  "",
  "There lay the city of Dis.",
  "It was so much more marvelous than she had ever imagined: a gleaming white castle, three rings thronged at the bottom by snaking inlets of water that churned against its foundations, black waves smashing so furiously against stone, bone, brick, that Alice could hear the distant roar where she stood.",
  "",
  "She had read much literature about Dis.",
  "The Land of the Damned.",
  "The Doleful City.",
  "For Virgil's Aeneid, Dis was the name for all of Hell itself, and, within its realm, a fortress ringed by three walls, surrounded by a river of fire.",
  "For Dante, Dis was only the city for the sixth through ninth circles of Hell, a great fortress in a land littered with broken sepulchers.",
  "Others said the city of Dis and Pandemonium were one and the same; the realm of Lucifer and the demons.",
  "They said Dis was a foul and evil place, forsaken by God.",
  "",
  "No one had prepared her for the city's beauty.",
  "",
  "Dante mentioned only that the city had high walls.",
  "He did not describe how those walls were the perfect mirror image of the sacred places its inhabitants had scorned; how Dis's architecture was a clear rebuke to the Vatican.",
  "No; in truth, it put the Vatican to shame.",
  "Michelangelo and Raphael had had only one lifetime to praise their God, but the inhabitants of Dis had eons.",
  "Dis was the extremes of human perfection.",
  "Dis was faultless marble, balustrades and domes, tiled courtyards lined with columns.",
  "Borges had written that the city was horrific, so horrific that the mere fact of its existence polluted the past and future, and compromised the stars; but had Alice and Borges witnessed the same city?",
  "Where Borges had found a perversion, Alice found a miracle.",
  "Dis was a millennium of effort, a haven constructed by those without salvation.",
  "Alice could see so clearly what it was trying to be, and what it could never be.",
  "But even in that fundamental lack there was something lovely, transcendent, a testament to human will.",
  "The city of Dis was defiant to the idea of an afterworld itself.",
  "They had left the campus behind now; this was a temple.",
  "Damn us, it said, and we will make Hell shine.",
  "",
  "Gradus's voice had a funny lilt to it. \"Suppose your man's in there.\"",
  "",
  "Alice felt a prickle across her skin. \"Is it dangerous?\"",
  "",
  "\"Hardly,\" said Gradus. \"Those in Dis are no threat to you. You'll see. They are very particular sinners.\"",
  "",
  "\"What do you mean? Who's in there?\"",
  "",
  "\"Traitors. Oath-breakers. Those who made a promise and failed to keep it.\"",
  "",
  "This answer disappointed her.",
  "She had always assumed Dante was exaggerating. \"That doesn't seem so bad.\"",
  "",
  "\"Doesn't it?\"",
  "",
  "\"Well, I mean, everyone breaks promises.\"",
  "",
  "\"There are trivial promises,\" agreed Gradus.",
  "\"And then there are declarations. Promises that say, This is what you mean to me, and this is what I owe to you. The kinds of promises a husband makes to a wife. That which a parent makes to a child. That which a teacher makes to a student.\"",
  "",
  "A chill ran over Alice's spine.",
  "",
  "Staring at Dis, she felt as if a shard of ice were pressing against her bosom.",
  "That beauty took on a vicious gleam.",
  "She sensed its inner sin—a biting, evil thing; that force that poisoned bonds, turned friend against friend and kin against kin.",
  "She could only describe that feeling as a violation; the sharpest, severest pain, that which pierced in her inner depths where she felt most safe.",
  "",
  "\"So what did you do, Gradus?\" she asked. \"Who did you betray?\"",
  "",
  "Some part of her wanted to get back at him, though she couldn't say for what.",
  "His silence?",
  "His sudden coldness?",
  "She felt judged and shamed by him, and now that he was speaking again, she wanted to make him hurt.",
  "Anyhow, he'd been so callous with his own questions, and she felt she could now be callous in return.",
  "",
  "\"You didn't ask that,\" said Gradus.",
  "",
  "\"Yes I did. What did you do? Why aren't you writing?\"",
  "",
  "\"Never ask that.\"",
  "",
  "Come on, she nearly said, but realized he was serious.",
  "There was no laughter in his face.",
  "",
  "\"I am warning you, Alice Law.\" Gradus's eyes were stone.",
  "He can't be from this century, Alice thought suddenly, no one from this century has such time-deadened eyes.",
  "He has been here for lifetimes.",
  "\"You may take confessions if freely offered. That is permitted. But if you wish to survive, remember this one rule about Dis. Never ask.\""

  "Matanya mengamati noda-noda kapur di sweternya. “Kau seorang penyihir.”",
  "",
  "“Ya.”",
  "",
  "Dia tertawa terbahak-bahak.",
  "",
  "“Astaga,” katanya. “Aku sudah menunggu, dan menunggu, dan sekarang kau di sini.”",
  "",
  "Alice merasa ini samar-samar mengancam.",
  "Dia bangkit berdiri, dan langsung menyesalinya; gelombang vertigo menerpanya dan dia terhuyung, pandangannya berdenyut hitam.",
  "",
  "Arwah itu mengangkat tangannya. “Aku tidak akan menyakitimu.”",
  "",
  "“Apa maumu?”",
  "",
  "“Hanya ingin bicara.” Arwah itu melesat maju, sampai sekali lagi dia berada hanya beberapa inci jauhnya.",
  "Dia tampaknya tidak punya konsep batasan pribadi.",
  "Tidak peduli bagaimana dia bergeser, wajah Arwah itu tetap menjulang di dekat wajahnya, seolah-olah hendak menjilat atau menciumnya. “Tapi kau, dari yang hidup—apa yang kau lakukan di sini, sendirian di Neraka?”",
  "",
  "Memang apa yang sedang dilakukannya?",
  "Tetap saja dia tidak punya jawaban, dan dia rasa Arwah ini tidak perlu mendengar penyesalannya. “Aku sedang mencari seseorang.”",
  "",
  "“Di mana kira-kira orang itu berada?”",
  "",
  "“Aku tidak tahu.” Dia menghela napas. “Aku sudah mencari di Neraka Atas. Aku telah mengembara di Pengadilan Kemurkaan, Kekejaman, Kekerasan, dan Tirani. Aku tidak pernah menemukannya, dan aku punya alasan untuk curiga dosa-dosanya tidak ringan.”",
 "",
  "“Kau pikir dia ada di Dis.”",
  "",
  "“A—ya, benar.” Alice yakin kota itu nyata; semua arsip yang dapat diandalkan menyetujuinya; tetapi dia terkejut mendengar namanya dikonfirmasi dari mulut orang mati.",
  "Jadi kota itu ada di sana, jadi kota itu menunggu. “Dia pasti ada di sana.”",
  "",
  "“Dan kau harus menemukan gerbangnya.”",
  "",
  "Aku punya pemandu, Alice ingin berkata, tetapi dia melihat sekarang Archimedes telah melarikan diri; dia sendirian lagi. “Kurasa begitu.”",
  "",
  "“Kalau begitu, ayo.” Arwah itu mengangguk ke arah cakrawala. “Akan kutunjukkan padamu. Perjalanan yang aman.”",
  "",
  "“Untuk apa?”",
  "",
  "“Apa maksudmu, untuk apa?”",
  "",
  "“Aku tidak bermaksud menyinggung.” Alice teringat George Edward Moore, yang tergila-gila ingin punya teman.",
  "Dia teringat tawa kekanakan si Gadis Penenun.",
  "Dia teringat Elspeth, yang merasa benar sendiri dan pendendam. “Hanya saja kami—aku tidak mengalami waktu yang menyenangkan di sini. Dan kita berada di Neraka Bawah. Semua orang menginginkan sesuatu.”",
  "",
  "Sekali lagi Arwah itu tertawa bergemuruh.",
  "Dia mengalihkan pandangannya kembali ke Alice, dan kali ini matanya menjadi hal yang paling padat pada dirinya; batu yang dalam, cekungan waktu. “Sebuah cerita untuk sebuah lagu,” katanya. “Itu saja. Kau ingin tahu tentang Dis. Aku ingin tahu tentang kehidupan.”",
  "",
  "Jadi di sinilah dia berada di lingkaran terdalam Neraka, berjalan-jalan santai dengan Arwah yang tidak dia ketahui dosa-dosanya.",
  "",
  "Alice tidak bisa menentukan apakah dia sangat beruntung atau sangat bodoh.",
  "Setidaknya Arwah ini—dia memperkenalkan dirinya sebagai John Gradus, yang tampaknya kebohongan yang nyata—tidak berpura-pura menjadi temannya.",
  "Keinginannya cukup jelas.",
  "Dia terus-menerus menanyainya untuk mendapatkan informasi tentang dunia yang Alice ketahui.",
  "Dia sama sekali tidak tertarik pada perkembangan politik atau sejarah.",
  "Alice mencoba memberitahunya tentang Uni Soviet, dan dia melambaikan tangan dengan tidak sabar.",
  "Sebaliknya, dia menginginkan cerita tentang merek kapur apa yang sekarang sedang tren (“Shropley's? Mereka belum bangkrut?”), makanan apa yang disajikan di aula makan (“Masih kentang tumbuk yang sama? Apa *Yorkshire pudding*-nya masih terasa seperti kardus?”), dan bagaimana mode pakaian mahasiswi berevolusi di kampus (Alice merasa agak jijik menggambarkannya, tetapi Gradus tampak puas dengan jawaban bergumam tentang rok dan stoking.",
  "Seberapa pendek? Dia tidak ingat.",
  "Di atas lutut? Yah, kadang-kadang.",
  "Bukan di kampus, tapi kadang-kadang.)",
  "Dia tidak keberatan dengan interogasi itu.",
  "Di sinilah ingatannya berguna, dan dia hanya perlu memejamkan mata, memanggil foto-foto ke benaknya, dan menceritakan detailnya sambil berjalan.",
  "",
  "“Kaki langit London?”",
  "",
  "“Ada banyak konstruksi baru. Mereka punya benda besar jelek ini, menara NatWest, mencuat lurus ke udara seperti puntung.”",
  "",
  "“Musiknya?”",
  "",
  "Dia teringat jendela toko kaset dan memberitahunya semua nama yang dia lihat di sana. “Judas Priest. Soup Dragons. Iron Maiden. Talking Heads.”",
  "",
  "“Musik jenis apa itu?”",
  "",
  "“Semacam . . . indie punk, rock, semacam itu? Maksudnya, kebalikan dari Dusty Springfield?”",
  "",
  "Dia tidak tahu apakah nama-nama itu berarti bagi John Gradus.",
  "Dia bertanya, “Apa kau menyukainya?”",
  "",
  "“Agak terlalu keras,” katanya. “Tapi aku tidak terlalu suka bertualang. Aku hanya suka The Beatles. Dan Bach.”",
 "",
  "“Sok intelek,” katanya. “Makanan terakhir yang kau makan?”",
  "",
  "“Roti Lembas.”",
  "",
  "“Bukan, maksudku sebelumnya.”",
  "",
  "“Oh.” Alice mengobrak-abrik pikirannya. “Um. Teh dan roti lapis panggang.”",
  "",
  "“Jenis apa?”",
  "",
  "“Keju. Cheddar, kurasa.”",
  "",
  "“Dipanaskan?”",
  "",
  "“Tidak, dingin.” Dia melihat bungkus plastiknya di benaknya, logo generiknya.",
  "Sajian larut malam dari kantin yang akan tutup. “Rasanya tidak terlalu enak.”",
  "",
  "“Roti lapis panggang dingin,” gumamnya. “Punya semua waktu di dunia, dan malah makan roti lapis panggang dingin yang membeku.”",
  "",
  "Dia lapar akan hal-hal yang nyata, yang material.",
  "Dia menjadi kesal ketika merasa Alice telah menyia-nyiakan waktunya di atas sana.",
  "Yang terpenting, dia kesal dengan peluang gastronomi yang terlewatkan.",
  "Dia tampaknya tidak bisa mengerti mengapa Alice tidak makan makanan *gourmet* tiga hidangan setiap hari.",
 "Jawaban “Aku tidak lapar” tidak masuk akal baginya.",
  "Dia memasang tatapan tajam dan kelaparan saat Alice berbicara sehingga kadang-kadang Alice merasa tidak nyaman; dia merasa Arwah itu sedang menyedot sesuatu darinya, meskipun dia tidak tahu apa.",
  "Kekuatan hidup, rasanya.",
  "Mungkin ketika mereka selesai, dia akan hampir hidup, dan Alice akan menjadi gumpalan abu-abu yang bergemuruh.",
  "Meskipun mengganggu, eksploitasi terang-terangan inilah yang, pada gilirannya, membuatnya mempercayai kata-katanya.",
  "Bisa jadi semudah ini.",
  "Bisa jadi dia benar-benar membawanya ke gerbang Dis.",
  "",
  "Dia melirik ke arahnya saat mereka berjalan, mencoba mengenali wajah pemandunya.",
  "Virgil-nya sendiri.",
  "Dia bertanya-tanya apakah dia bisa mengenalinya, apakah ceritanya adalah salah satu dari banyak desas-desus yang menghantui akademi.",
  "Apakah dia ahli demonologi yang mengumpankan bayi perempuannya kepada Azazel?",
  "Ahli kriptologi yang mengirim murid-muridnya ke Faerie tanpa tali penyelamat?",
  "",
 "Sayangnya Gradus tidak berusaha keras mempertahankan wujud padat seperti Elspeth.",
  "Jika dia fokus terlalu keras pada matanya, atau pada perawakannya, fitur-fiturnya menyelinap dan berubah seolah-olah tidak bisa memutuskan seperti apa wujudnya dulu.",
  "Anehnya, dia mengambil bentuk paling jelas ketika Alice melihatnya sekilas dari sudut matanya, ketika imajinasinya bisa melengkapi sisanya.",
  "Seorang pria tegap berkacamata, tipe orang yang mungkin membawa tas kerja, atau yang mungkin menawarimu payung saat hujan.",
  "Pria yang benar-benar mudah dilupakan.",
  "Kau melihatnya di kereta, atau di perpustakaan universitas, atau di toko buku.",
  "Dan kemudian dia berjalan keluar dari hidupmu dan kau melupakan segalanya tentang dia; karena bentuk-bentuk seperti dia hanya ada untuk mengisi latar belakang duniamu sendiri yang lebih kaya.",
  "Gradus adalah pria yang sama sekali tanpa kekhususan, dan Alice curiga dia telah bekerja sangat keras untuk membuatnya begitu.",
  "",
  "Alice mencoba menempatkannya setidaknya secara geografis atau temporal, karena dengan begitu dia setidaknya bisa menelusuri ingatannya untuk menyebutkan kejahatan mengerikan apa pun, katakanlah, di Yale pada tahun enam puluhan, tetapi Gradus sudah begitu lama berada di dunia bawah sehingga dia tidak membuat referensi untuk menempatkan dirinya.",
 "Kadang-kadang dia merasa mendeteksi nada samar Nordik dalam pidatonya, tetapi selain itu dia memiliki aksen misterius mid-Atlantic yang bisa jadi milik orang Inggris yang terlalu lama bergaul dengan orang Amerika, atau orang Amerika yang terlalu lama tinggal di Inggris.",
  "Dia tidak blak-blakan.",
  "Dia pernah mencoba bertanya dari mana asalnya, dan yang dia katakan hanyalah, “Aku ingin lihat kau menebak.”",
  "Justru dia tampaknya senang mempermainkannya.",
"Dia akan membuat referensi ke Roosevelt dan Churchill, lalu mengisyaratkan bahwa dia mengenal Copernicus secara pribadi.",
  "",
  "Suatu kali kecurigaan muncul, dan dia bertanya dengan cepat, untuk membuatnya lengah, “Jacob?”",
  "",
  "Profesor Grimes selalu menyukai tes-tes kecilnya.",
  "",
  "Tetapi John Gradus hanya bergumam dan bertanya, “Apa itu?”",
 "",
  "Tidak, dia tidak mungkin Profesor Grimes.",
  "Profesor Grimes tidak terlalu peduli dengan dunia di luar kantornya.",
  "Dia tidak akan pernah bertanya padanya tentang Talking Heads.",
  "Mode berubah; Profesor Grimes tetap sama.",
  "Dia tinggal di istana di awan.",
  "Yang penting hanyalah ide-idenya, dan seberapa jauh ide-ide itu bisa membawanya.",
  "",
  "Setidaknya John Gradus memberi sebanyak yang dia dapatkan, selama Alice tidak banyak bertanya tentang identitas pribadi.",
  "Tentang topik Neraka, dia sangat blak-blakan, meski tidak selalu membantu.",
  "Sebagian besar dari apa yang dia katakan meninggalkan Alice dengan sejuta pertanyaan lagi.",
  "Alice bertanya kepadanya apa itu potongan-potongan tulisan itu, dan dia menjelaskan, \"Yah, disertasi, tentu saja. Itu seharusnya sudah jelas.\"",
  "",
  "\"Disertasi tentang apa?\"",
  "",
  "\"Tentang apa pun dosa kita.\"",
  "",
  "\"Apa semua orang menulisnya?\"",
  "",
  "\"Kita semua harus menulisnya.\"",
  "",
  "\"Siapa yang membacanya?\"",
  "",
  "\"Siapa pun yang bertanggung jawab. Para Erinyes. Tuan Yama sendiri. Siapa tahu? Aku belum pernah menyaksikan siapa pun membacanya, asal kau tahu, tapi memang jarang ada disertasi yang lolos. Mereka bilang menulislah sampai kau menghasilkan karya terbaikmu, dan ketika kau sudah menghasilkan karya terbaikmu, kapal-kapal akan datang untuk membawamu menyeberangi Lethe.\"",
"",
  "\"Apa tujuannya?\"",
  "",
  "\"Hiburan, aku yakin. Aku sendiri senang membaca draf orang lain. Aku menemukan setumpuk draf dengan subjudul *My Lolita* tempo hari. Nah, yang itu seru sekali!\"",
  "",
  "\"Maksudku, apa yang membuat disertasi itu bagus?\"",
  "",
  "\"Mana kutahu. Itulah teka-tekinya, kan?\"",
  "",
  "Alice tidak tahu apakah dia sengaja bersikap seenaknya atau apakah dia benar-benar tidak tahu.",
  "\"Jadi begitukah caramu dihukum? Kau tidak bisa keluar sampai kau benar-benar memahami kejahatanmu sendiri?\"",
  "",
  "\"Beberapa orang berpikir begitu.\"",
  "",
  "\"Lalu bagaimana caramu lulus?\"",
  "",
  "Ini membuat Gradus berdeham.",
"Setelah jeda, dia berkata, \"Satu-satunya hal yang diketahui semua orang dengan pasti adalah bahwa mereka bilang kau harus mengatakan yang sebenarnya. Itu saja.\"",
  "",
  "\"Apa sangat sulit untuk mengatakan yang sebenarnya?\"",
  "",
  "\"Pasti begitu. Belum pernah melihat siapa pun keluar.\"",
  "",
  "\"Itu pasti membuat mereka gila,\" Alice merenung.",
  "Dia kenal cukup banyak mahasiswa yang sedang mengerjakan disertasi.",
  "Di Cambridge, standar untuk disertasi yang bagus tampaknya asimtotik.",
 "Semakin dekat kau, semakin jelas bahwa kau tidak akan pernah mencapai batasnya.",
  "Pada akhirnya yang menentukan adalah batasan waktu—kau menyerahkan pekerjaan pada tenggat waktu, sempurna atau tidak.",
  "Tapi tidak ada tenggat waktu di Neraka.",
  "Kau punya waktu selamanya untuk berbuat salah. \"Aku yakin itu menyiksa.\"",

  "\"Mungkin,\" kata Gradus. \"Aku tidak mencoba.\"",

"\"Kenapa tidak?\"",

  "\"Oh—yah, aku tidak begitu tahu.\" Alice berhenti sejenak.",
  "Apa dosa terburuk yang pernah dilakukan Profesor Grimes?",
  "Ketika dia memikirkannya, dia tidak bisa menemukan apa pun selain deskripsi yang paling samar, dan tidak ada yang terasa benar.",
  "Dia mencuri (tapi untuk alasan yang baik).",
  "Dia kejam (dengan tujuan baik, kepada mereka yang pantas mendapatkannya).",
  "\"Kami berdua punya teori masing-masing, tapi kurasa tidak ada cara untuk mengetahuinya.\"",

  "Lalu apa?",
 "Dia terus menanyakan ini.",
  "Lalu apa?",
  "Lalu apa?",
  "Seperti anak kecil yang meminta lebih banyak permen, menikmati setiap tetes emosi kehidupan yang bisa dia peras darinya.",
  "Dia menceritakan kepadanya tentang si Gadis Penenun tetapi tetap samar tentang Elspeth; dia menggambarkan rawa di Pengadilan Kemurkaan, dan perangkap Escher, jam kukuk, pengorbanan Peter.",
  "Decitan logam.",
  "Kesenangan para Kripkes.",
  "",
  "\"Tunggu.\" Gradus berhenti berjalan.",
  "Auranya berubah.",
  "Pusaran abu-abu yang mendesis dan acuh tak acuh itu terdiam menjadi sesuatu yang manusiawi—rasa dingin yang sangat Alice kenali.",

  "",
  "\"Tapi sekarang ini seru!\" Gradus merentangkan tangannya, telapak tangan terbuka.",
  "\"Sebuah tragedi, kisah balas dendam, penyelamatan, berpacu dengan waktu. Akankah kau lolos dari para Kripkes? Atau akankah mereka memburumu, sebelum kau bisa menyelesaikan pencarian rekanmu yang gugur?\"",
 "",
  "\"Kurasa begitu.\"",
  "",
  "\"Apa maksudmu, kau rasa begitu?\"",
  "",
  "\"Maksudku, kedengarannya seperti naskah yang bagus.\" Alice merasa sangat lelah. \"Kurasa aku akan mengikutinya.\"",
"",
  "\"Apa maksudmu, kau akan mengikutinya?\" Entah bagaimana dia telah membuat Gradus gelisah.",
  "Jubahnya mulai mencambuk di sekitar tumit mereka berdua, seolah-olah dia bisa melingkari Alice dalam pusaran kejengkelannya.",
 "\"Apa kau tidak kesal?\" tuntutnya. \"Apa kau tidak hancur?\"",
  "",
  "\"Tentu saja, Gradus.\"",
  "",
  "\"Kau terdengar seolah-olah kau bahkan tidak tahu apa yang kau lakukan di sini.\"",

  "Bagaimana dia bisa menjelaskan mati rasa ini padanya?",
  "Bukannya Alice tidak peduli, hanya saja dia sudah terlalu peduli, dan seutas benang telah putus.",
  "Kapasitas mendasar telah rusak.",
  "Dia merasa terlempar keluar dari dunia makna, perasaan, keterikatan.",
  "Dia tidak bisa berdarah lagi.",
  "Dia sudah terkuras.",
  "Naskah adalah satu-satunya yang dimilikinya sekarang, dan itu cukup untuk membuatnya tetap berjalan, tetapi tidak cukup untuk membuat jantungnya mulai berdetak.",

  "\"Melawan semua keinginanku. Ya.\"",
  "",
  "Gradus tidak berkata apa-apa.",
"Dia berjalan dan menunggu, berharap Gradus akan mengganti topik pembicaraan, tetapi dia tetap diam.",
  "Dia merasa telah membuatnya kesal, tetapi bagaimana caranya, dia tidak tahu.",
  "Gradus tidak tampak seperti tipe yang sensitif.",
  "Sampai sekarang dia merasa nyaman dalam hubungan mereka yang tidak berperasaan.",
  "Pada satu titik dia pernah menyindir bahwa Gradus adalah Jack the Ripper, dan dia hanya tertawa.",
  "",
  "Tetapi dia tidak bertanya lagi.",
  "Sepanjang sisa pagi itu mereka berjalan dalam diam.",
  "Satu atau dua kali dia bergumam sendiri, tetapi Alice tidak bisa memahami apa yang dikatakannya.",
  "Dia hanya merasakan kekesalannya, gelombang pahit dan permusuhan, yang sama mendadaknya dengan membingungkan.",
 "Dan Alice, yang sudah terbiasa menenangkan pria-pria labil, hanya bisa menunggu hukumannya.",
  "",
  "\"Jadi.\" Gradus akhirnya angkat bicara. \"Itu dia.\"",
  "",
  "Selama satu jam terakhir mereka telah mendaki bukit yang curam dan berbatu.",
"Alice hampir membungkuk karena kelelahan, tangan di atas lututnya.",
  "Matanya jarang sekali beralih dari tanah di depannya.",
  "Sekarang dia mengangkat kepalanya, menegakkan badan, dan terkesiap.",
  "",
  "Di sanalah terletak kota Dis.",
  "Jauh lebih mengagumkan daripada yang pernah dia bayangkan: kastel putih berkilauan, tiga cincin yang dipadati di bagian bawah oleh ceruk-ceruk air yang berkelok-kelok yang bergolak menghantam fondasinya, ombak hitam menghantam batu, tulang, bata, dengan begitu dahsyatnya, sehingga Alice bisa mendengar gemuruhnya dari tempatnya berdiri.",
 "",
  "Dia telah membaca banyak literatur tentang Dis.",
  "Tanah Terkutuk.",
  "Kota Duka.",
  "Bagi *Aeneid* karya Virgil, Dis adalah nama untuk seluruh Neraka itu sendiri, dan, di dalam wilayahnya, sebuah benteng yang dilingkari oleh tiga dinding, dikelilingi oleh sungai api.",
  "Bagi Dante, Dis hanyalah kota untuk lingkaran keenam sampai kesembilan Neraka, sebuah benteng besar di negeri yang dipenuhi dengan kuburan-kuburan yang hancur.",
  "Yang lain mengatakan kota Dis dan Pandemonium adalah satu dan sama; alam Lucifer dan para iblis.",
  "Mereka bilang Dis adalah tempat yang kotor dan jahat, ditinggalkan oleh Tuhan.",
  "",
  "Tidak ada yang mempersiapkannya untuk keindahan kota itu.",
  "",
 "Dante hanya menyebutkan bahwa kota itu memiliki tembok tinggi.",
  "Dia tidak menggambarkan bagaimana tembok-tembok itu adalah bayangan cermin yang sempurna dari tempat-tempat suci yang telah dicemooh oleh penghuninya; bagaimana arsitektur Dis merupakan teguran yang jelas bagi Vatikan.",
  "Tidak; sejujurnya, itu membuat Vatikan malu.",
 "Michelangelo dan Raphael hanya punya satu masa kehidupan untuk memuji Tuhan mereka, tetapi penghuni Dis punya waktu ribuan tahun.",
  "Dis adalah kesempurnaan manusia yang ekstrem.",
  "Dis adalah marmer tanpa cela, langkan dan kubah, halaman berubin yang dipagari pilar-pilar.",
"Borges pernah menulis bahwa kota itu mengerikan, begitu mengerikan sehingga fakta keberadaannya saja telah mencemari masa lalu dan masa depan, dan menodai bintang-bintang; tetapi apakah Alice dan Borges menyaksikan kota yang sama?",
  "Di mana Borges menemukan penyimpangan, Alice menemukan keajaiban.",
  "Dis adalah hasil usaha seribu tahun, sebuah surga yang dibangun oleh mereka yang tidak memiliki keselamatan.",
  "Alice bisa melihat dengan sangat jelas apa yang coba diwujudkannya, dan apa yang tidak akan pernah bisa diwujudkannya.",
  "Tetapi bahkan dalam kekurangan mendasar itu ada sesuatu yang indah, transenden, sebuah bukti kehendak manusia.",
  "Kota Dis menentang gagasan tentang akhirat itu sendiri.",
  "Mereka telah meninggalkan kampus sekarang; ini adalah sebuah kuil.",
  "Kutuk kami, katanya, dan kami akan membuat Neraka bersinar.",
 "",
  "Suara Gradus memiliki nada yang aneh. \"Misalkan orangmu ada di dalam sana.\"",
  "",
  "Alice merasakan bulu kuduknya meremang. \"Apa itu berbahaya?\"",
  "",
 "\"Sama sekali tidak,\" kata Gradus. \"Mereka yang ada di Dis bukanlah ancaman bagimu. Kau akan lihat. Mereka adalah pendosa yang sangat khusus.\"",
  "",
  "\"Apa maksudmu? Siapa yang ada di sana?\"",
  "",
  "\"Para pengkhianat. Pelanggar sumpah. Mereka yang membuat janji dan gagal menepatinya.\"",

  "Dia selalu berasumsi Dante melebih-lebihkan. \"Kedengarannya tidak terlalu buruk.\"",
  "",
  "\"Begitukah?\"",
  "",
  "\"Yah, maksudku, semua orang melanggar janji.\"",
  "",
  "\"Ada janji-janji sepele,\" Gradus setuju.",
 "\"Dan lalu ada deklarasi. Janji-janji yang mengatakan, Inilah artimu bagiku, dan inilah utangku padamu. Jenis janji yang dibuat suami kepada istri. Janji yang dibuat orang tua kepada anak. Janji yang dibuat guru kepada murid.\"",
 "",
  "Rasa dingin menjalari tulang punggung Alice.",
  "",
  "Menatap Dis, dia merasa seolah-olah ada pecahan es yang menekan dadanya.",
  "Keindahan itu memancarkan kilau yang kejam.",
  "Dia merasakan dosa di dalamnya—sesuatu yang menggigit, jahat; kekuatan yang meracuni ikatan, mengubah teman melawan teman dan kerabat melawan kerabat.",
 "Dia hanya bisa menggambarkan perasaan itu sebagai pelanggaran; rasa sakit yang paling tajam, paling parah, yang menusuk di lubuk hatinya yang paling dalam, tempat dia merasa paling aman.",
  "",
  "\"Jadi apa yang kau lakukan, Gradus?\" tanyanya. \"Siapa yang kau khianati?\"",
  "",
  "Sebagian dari dirinya ingin membalasnya, meskipun dia tidak tahu untuk apa.",
 "Keheningannya?",
  "Sikap dinginnya yang tiba-tiba?",
  "Dia merasa dihakimi dan dipermalukan olehnya, dan sekarang setelah dia berbicara lagi, dia ingin membuatnya sakit hati.",
  "Lagi pula, dia begitu tidak berperasaan dengan pertanyaan-pertanyaannya sendiri, dan Alice merasa sekarang dia bisa membalasnya dengan tidak berperasaan.",

  "\"Kau tidak menanyakan itu,\" kata Gradus.",

  "\"Aku peringatkan kau, Alice Law.\" Mata Gradus sekeras batu.",
"Dia tidak mungkin berasal dari abad ini, Alice tiba-tiba berpikir, tidak ada seorang pun dari abad ini yang memiliki mata semati itu.",

  "He watched them approach with his chest puffed out; one hand on his hip, one hand clutching a black spear with a carved stone tip.",
  "He slammed this spear thrice on the marble as they ascended.",
  "“Who dares enter the Great City of the Damned?”",

  "“Don’t answer.” Gradus pushed his way past Parmenides.",
  "The doors rumbled open at his touch.",

  "Gradus waved a hand.",
  "“Come along, Alice.”",
  "",
  "Alice scurried behind him.",
  "",
  "“Trade you a story for a story,” Parmenides called behind them.",
  "Alice was afraid he would follow them through, but he only stood on the threshold, brandishing his spear as the doors screeched against the marble floor.",
  "“You know where to find me.”",
  "",
  "The doors thudded shut.",
  "",
  "Inside was darkness, cool and silent.",
  "Gradus drifted down a hall to the right.",
  "Alice followed.",
  "She heard a crescendoing hubbub of voices, just before Gradus opened a door and they spilled out into a courtyard, open space enclosed by four walls that reminded Alice of abbey cloisters.",
  "Nothing green grew, but the sculptural arrangement of rocks, and the floral mosaic patterns across the tile, suggested a meticulous attempt at upkeep.",
  "The effect was surprisingly pleasant.",
  "A tall, twisted white tree stood at its center, and Alice could not tell if it was dead or carved from stone.",
  "Under its branches, clumped in groups of three or four, milled several dozen murmuring Shades.",
  "",
  "“Think your professor’s in here?” Gradus asked.",
  "",
  "Alice couldn’t be sure.",
  "The problem was there were too many Shades who looked like Professor Grimes in this courtyard.",
  "She had not expected to end up in a courtyard so full of middle-aged men.",
  "Half of them wore glasses, and all were draped in some version of the dark Oxbridge robe.",
  "",
  "“Go on!”",
  "“That’s right, go on!”",
  "",
  "Quite a lot of the Shades were clustered in a huddle in the far corner of the courtyard.",
  "They were egging on one Shade at the wall, who stood with one hand grasping a thick stack of bound pages, the other resting on what looked like the handle of a library book-drop drawer embedded in the wall.",
  "He kept pulling it open, shuddering as if in panic, and letting it slide closed.",
  "Each time he did, the Shades booed in chorus.",
  "",
  "“Let it drop,” they cried.",
  "“Let it drop!”",
  "",
  "“Suppose it’s not ready,” said the Shade at the wall.",
  "",
  "“Not this again.”",
  "“It’s been decades.”",
  "“If not now, when?”",
  "",
  "“All right,” said the Shade.",
  "“All right.”",
  "",
  "He squeezed his eyes shut—and looked rather silly as he did so, like a child pinching his nose before jumping into a pool—and slid his dissertation into the drawer.",
  "He let go and flinched back.",
  "The drawer slammed shut with a resounding metal twang.",
  "Everyone glared expectantly at the drawer, but nothing happened.",
  "Eventually there was a lukewarm smatter of applause.",
  "The Shades continued watching the drawer for a few moments and then dispersed again into their cliques, murmuring in disappointment.",
  "",
  "“What happened?” Alice asked.",
  "",
  "“Someone’s just submitted a dissertation,” said Gradus.",

  "“Where’s that drawer lead?”",

  "“Marks.” Gradus chuckled.",
  "“Imagine, marks.",
  "No, they don’t tell you anything unless you’ve passed.",
  "We don’t get revisions.",
  "We receive no feedback whatsoever.",
  "We just wait in anticipation forever and ever, until hope turns to panic to disappointment.",
  "If you hear nothing, then you must assume you’ve failed.",
  "Only there’s never confirmation, and timelines here mean nothing, and so it’s up to you when to extinguish your own hope.”",
  "",
  "Under the tree, several Shades bickered over the same question.",
  "",
  "“I’m telling you, the Furies aren’t reading them.”",
  "",
  "“Well if not the Furies, then who?”",
  "",
  "“You must be new here,” scoffed one Shade, and this roused chuckles around the courtyard.",
  "“It’s the victims, see, we’ve got to wait for the victims to die, and then they decide if it’s sufficient—”",
  "",
  "“But that doesn’t make any sense.",
  "Why would the victims hang around?”",
  "",
  "“What did Socrates say? Their calls are followed by supplication, as they beg their victims to permit their exit from their river . . .”",
  "",
  "“Socrates was put to death for being annoying, Socrates’s opinion doesn’t count for anything.”",
  "",
  "“Anyhow, who cares about the victims’ opinions? What makes them such moral experts?”",
  "",
  "“Right, suppose two robbers shoot each other in the head at the same moment.”",
  "",
  "“Come on, that’s not what happened to you.”",
  "",
  "“Point-blank and the other guy in bed, is more like it was—”",
  "",
  "“But suppose,” insisted the Shade who’d first leveled the objection.",
  "“Suppose two robbers shoot each other, and they’re both victims and perpetrators, and no one has the moral high ground.",
  "Who’s reading then? Whose forgiveness matters? Who gets to decide?”",
  "",
  "There was a hubbub of voices as Shades descended to weigh in on moral agency, forgiveness, and whether you could still be wronged if you did something wrong first.",
  "This seemed an old topic in the courtyard, something controversial and divisive and somehow such a familiar argument that all sides had long rehearsed their positions.",
  "Someone shouted about Jesus and unconditional love, and the whole forum groaned.",
  "",
  "The Shade who had submitted his dissertation stood hunched and alone at the wall, looking forlorn.",
  "Every now and then he traced a finger across the drawer handle, as if he could will it to respond.",
  "",
  "“Come on.” Gradus urged Alice toward an exit across the courtyard.",
  "“We’ll try the Writing Bazaar first.",
  "Then the workshops.”",
  "",
  "Alice thought perhaps Gradus meant “Writing Bazaar” in the sense that Harper’s Bazaar meant “bazaar,” which is to say a metaphorical marketplace of ideas.",
  "She expected a conference, perhaps, or a shelf of print journals.",
  "She did not anticipate a bazaar in the fantastic Oriental sense: a chaotic marketplace, stalls and stalls in rows where hawkers yelled their goods and Shades drifted through the rows, buying and bartering.",
  "After the stretching silence of the desert this was all quite overwhelming, and Alice nearly tripped over a Shade squatting by the gate.",
  "The Shade squawked and fell back, toppling stacks of yellowed paper behind her.",
  "",
  "“I’m sorry,” gasped Alice.",
  "“I didn’t see you—”",
  "",
  "The Shade muttered something Alice could not make out.",
  "Though she did not seem to be speaking to Alice.",
  "Rather, she whispered something fiercely at the sheet of paper she clutched in her hands.",
  "Alice realized then that the Shade was reading each page out loud at a crawling pace, stopping every so often to mutter questions about prepositional phrases and object pronouns.",
  "She had beside her a copy of Strunk and White’s The Elements of Style, which Alice had not seen since grade school.",
  "",
  "“She’s fine,” said Gradus, tugging her along.",
  "“She’s just doing copyedits.”",
  "",
  "“Copyedits?”",
  "",
  "“Lots of Shades believe they can fail for the slightest spelling error.",
  "They spend decades combing over their manuscripts before they feel comfortable submitting.”",
  "",
  "Alice thought of Professor Grimes, whose eyes slid so quickly over student papers she wondered sometimes if he registered their content at all.",
  "“Do the judges even care?”",
  "",
  "“No one knows,” said Gradus.",
  "“They never explain why they reject dissertations.",
  "All we can do is cover our bases as best we can.”",
  "",
  "Behind them, the Shade was howling and smacking herself against the temple.",
  "",
  "“Stupid,” she cried.",
  "“Stupid, stupid—it’s two spaces after each period! Oh, it’s all got to be redone!”",
  "",
  "The next stall was completely taken over by pyramids of used books.",
  "The collection was enormous.",
  "Elspeth’s library was paltry in comparison.",
  "All the books were battered and stained to various degrees.",
  "Some missed covers; some missed entire chunks in the middle; some appeared to have been dredged from the bottom of the river, dried, and painstakingly rebound with needle and thread.",
  "Still they looked and smelled enticing, for all books, like wine, had a readerly aroma that ripened with age, which was why bookstores and libraries smelled so good.",
  "Alice’s fingers itched with the familiar urge to flip through the volumes.",
  "The hawker perked up when he sensed her attention.",
  "He passed immaterial through the piles and stopped right before her.",
  "“De Quincey?” He held up two volumes, one thick and one slim.",
  "“De Sade?”",
  "",
  "“None today, thank you,” said Gradus.",
  "",
  "“You sure? De Sade’s very fun.",
  "If not for remorse, then for titillation.”",
  "",
  "Gradus held up a hand as he moved past.",
  "“We’re fine.”",
  "",
  "“Rousseau, then,” called the hawker.",
  "“You’ll like that.”",
  "",
  "“What’s he mean?” asked Alice.",
  "",
  "“He sells confessional texts,” said Gradus.",
  "“Saint Augustine, Saint Patrick, and so on.",
  "Lots of folks here think that’s the template.”",
  "",
  "“So they read for inspiration?”",
  "",
  "“Sure.",
  "Or to cheat.",
  "People like to copy down all the good bits—the part about souls being rendered in two, the fires of guilt burning you up from the inside, blah blah blah.”",
  "",
  "“Or divine salvation,” called the hawker.",
  "“New translated edition of Crime and Punishment here now, brand-new, excavated in mint condition from a Derbyshire tomb—”",
  "",
  "“No, thank you.” Gradus quickened his pace.",
  "",
  "“Does that work?” Alice hurried behind him.",
  "“Copying down confessions?”",
  "",
  "“Oh, never.",
  "They always know when it’s not original work.",
  "They take plagiarism quite seriously here—somehow folks always forget.",
  "A while ago someone copied two sentences from the Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and they wouldn’t let him touch paper again for fifty years.”",
  "",
  "“Gosh,” Alice muttered.",
  "“Who wouldn’t do their own work in Hell?”",
  "",
  "“Everyone,” said Gradus.",
  "“Haven’t you ever had writer’s block?”",
  "",
  "“Well of course, but—”",
  "",
  "“Did someone mention writer’s block?”",
  "",
  "Alice ran smack into what felt like a great, meaty wall.",
  "She stumbled black.",
  "Before her stood a veritable centaur; a man’s head and muscly torso over the indigo-blue bottom of a horse.",
  "She would have found him very handsome, in the rugged mountain-man fashion, were his mouth not split in a massive, toothy grin that indicated he wanted to eat her.",
  "",
  "“I’m sorry—”",
  "",
  "“No apologies necessary.” He dipped his head and forelegs in a low bow that should not have looked so elegant as it did.",
  "His head ended up somewhere near Alice’s crotch, which was both startling and titillating.",
  "“I am Nessus.” His voice was wonderfully smooth.",
  "“Lower chthonic deity, itinerant writing tutor of Dis, at your service.”",
  "",
  "“Bugger off,” said Gradus.",
  "",
  "Nessus rose and grasped Alice’s hands.",
  "“Are you new to the city, love? First time in the bazaar?”",
  "",
  "“Yes, I—”",
  "",
  "“Never fear!” He squeezed her hands tight.",
  "His skin was very warm.",
  "“I am here to offer any paper-writing services you need.",
  "Proposals, outlines, bibliographies, even entire dissertation chapters if you so desire.",
  "Rates are negotiable—”",
  "",
  "“Leave her alone,” said Gradus.",
  "",
  "“Does that work?” asked Alice, intrigued.",
  "",
  "“Of course it doesn’t,” said Gradus.",
  "“No one wants those phony essays.”",
  "",
  "“Our essays are the best on the market.” Nessus continued to ignore Gradus.",
  "Indeed, every time Gradus spoke, Nessus only opened his mouth further, continuing on with his pitch at a deafening shout.",
  "“WE HAVE HELPED HUNDREDS OF SOULS PASS THEIR DISSERTATION DEFENSES AND FIND PASSAGE ACROSS THE LETHE ON LONG-AWAITED GOLDEN SHIPS—”",
  "",
  "“It’s a complete scam,” said Gradus.",
  "",
  "“OUR ESSAY WRITERS HAVE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORKINGS OF THE UNDERWORLD.",
  "MANY HAVE WALKED THE SANDS OF DEATH SINCE THE BIRTH OF THE WORLD—”",
  "",
  "“But you’re all deities!” Alice exclaimed.",
  "“What can you possibly want for trade from humans?”",
  "",
  "Nessus ceased his shouting, looked her up and down, and murmured close into her ear.",
  "“A human soul can be useful in more ways than one.”",
  "",
  "Alice did not quite understand what he meant, but she knew enough to jerk her hands away.",
  "",
  "“Leave her alone.” Gradus grasped Alice’s arm and dragged her down the stalls.",
  "Nessus did not follow.",
  "When Alice glanced back over her shoulder he was in avid negotiations with another Shade, haggling over word counts and delivery times.",
  "",
  "“Haven’t you ever been in a market before?” Gradus demanded.",
  "“You keep your gaze forward, you never respond—”",
  "",
  "“Sorry,” Alice gasped.",
  "“It’s just—there’s so many—”",
  "",
  "“The bazaar is built to distract,” said Gradus.",
  "“This is Lord Yama’s design.",
  "There’s a million things to keep a soul from writing, all in the service of making you better at it.",
  "Remember that, Alice Law.",
  "Hell is a writers’ market.”",
  "",
  "The bazaar seemed endless.",
  "Lost in the thick of it, Alice could not see any way out.",
  "Only Gradus seemed to know where they were going, ducking and weaving around hawkers with irritable indifference.",
  "They passed stalls of writing accoutrements and productivity cures—old typewriters, reams of paper, sand hourglasses (“DON’T PROCRASTINATE FOR ETERNITY!”), self-help books (How to Write a Confession in Ten Days, Two Thousand Words a Day: The Augustinian Method), and black quills advertised as bona fide vulture feathers (“SAY NO TO THE TYPEWRITER: WRITE IN ANALOG TO PROMPT YOUR CREATIVE MIND”).",
  "Alice couldn’t quite understand what passed for currency in Dis—she saw Shades exchanging all sorts of trinkets, from buttons to bottle caps to what appeared to be human knucklebones—but the trade, evidently, was thriving.",
  "",
  "The traffic thickened.",
  "They pushed their way forth and came upon a packed crowd gathered around a creature—a deity, Alice saw, a giant with an elephantine head, his skull studded with too many eyes.",
  "Two great horns extended from his temples, but Alice’s eyes could not track where they ended.",
  "She could only describe those horn tips as ending many places at once, a cloud of probability.",
  "Indeed Alice found the deity himself hard to look at; his form kept shifting in space, so that the moment she thought she had fixed him in her vision, he was several inches to the left.",
  "",
  "“Who—”",
  "",
  "“Laplace’s Demon,” said Gradus.",
  "",
  "“Laplace’s Demon is real?”",
  "",
  "“Oh, yes.",
  "He likes to wander the bazaar and talk people into thinking nothing is their fault.",
  "Sets them back decades in their progress.",
  "Come round this way, you’ll get lost in the crush.”",
  "",
  "Alice followed him to the edge of the crowd.",
  "The demon’s followers listened in rapturous excitement as he pronounced facts about their lives, explanations of their pathology.",
  "Someone’s pet cat had died when they were ten.",
  "Someone had been spanked too hard by a babysitter.",
  "Someone was genetically predisposed to anger.",
  "",
  "“How does he do that?”",
  "",
  "“Well, he’s a determinist,” said Gradus.",
  "“So he thinks just because he knows everything about you, that frees you of all personal responsibility from everything you’ve ever done.”",
  "",
  "“How would that work?”",
  "",
  "“Laplace’s Demon has been observing the universe since its very beginning,” said Gradus.",
  "“Or so he says.",
  "The first collision of atoms, the big bang, all that.",
  "He watched the first cells on Earth become sentient life.",
  "He watched as the atoms they were composed of interacted in new and exciting combinations to create generations.",
  "He knows, because of set natural laws of the universe, precisely how those atoms will interact in the future to form new combinations, and so on.",
  "He knows, when you are deciding between an apple and orange, what you will choose.",
  "He knows if someday you will betray your husband, or drown your child.",
  "He knows all, for every ill deed you have ever done was determined the day you were born.",
  "Life is a set course that you were born onto, a course you can never escape.",
  "You don’t know that you are even following it.”",
  "",
  "“What if I choose different?”",
  "",
  "“It doesn’t matter,” said Gradus.",
  "“He will have anticipated this too.",
  "He knows one day you will think of determinism and feel compelled to resist.",
  "And he knows you will choose what seems unpredictable for the sake of it.",
  "Laplace’s Demon knows all.”",
  "",
  "“And that means no one can ever be responsible for anything.” Alice had caught on now.",
  "“Which means there’s no concept of guilt, or culpability . . . I mean, could it work? If you could explain all your sins as the product of forces outside your control?”",
  "",
  "“Maybe.",
  "I don’t know.”",
  "",
  "She huffed.",
  "“Don’t you know anything?”",
  "",
  "“I know everything there is to know about this place,” said Gradus.",
  "“And I’m offering that knowledge freely, by the way, which is a better deal than you’d get elsewhere.”",
  "",
  "“Then how come you can’t say how a dissertation passes?”",
  "",
  "“Because.” Again Gradus’s essence took on that frightening, deadened calque.",
  "Alice felt the weight of accumulation, of layers on layers of time.",
  "“I don’t know how it’s done.",
  "Because nobody knows how it’s done.",
  "Because I have never once seen a passing dissertation in the entire time I have been in Hell.",
  "Because many of us think that the dissertation is a pointless exercise offered by sadistic deities to keep us distracted, because wouldn’t that be so funny, wouldn’t it be the best and cruelest joke to keep us running in circles around the bazaar forever.",
  "Because none of us in this wretched place have ever been given reason to hope.”",
  "",
  "“Oh,” said Alice, in a very small voice.",
  "“I see.”",
  "",
  "Dis did not feel so impressive now.",
  "The bazaar’s hustle was no longer amusing.",
  "Now the stalls and crowds struck her as a dreadful show; teeming and desperate, hamsters spinning circles in a pathetic ornate cage, all to avoid the only question that seemed to matter: why did you sin?",
  "",
  "Could she write her own way out of Hell? Alice wondered.",
  "If she somehow died a natural death, if she ended up in Dis.",
  "Could she face down the blank white paper and tell the truth?",
  "",
  "She knew what her great crime was.",
  "She had let Peter Murdoch die.",
  "She had killed Peter Murdoch.",
  "",
  "Now, Alice knew from conversations in hall that the philosophers at Cambridge were greatly concerned with the difference between killing and letting die.",
  "Some argued that there was no distinction: that if you knew the cause of death and failed to stop it even if you were able, then that was morally tantamount to murder.",
  "Others disagreed.",
  "Letting die might be morally callous, they argued, but it entailed refusing to get involved in a situation, not bringing it about.",
  "If letting die was so evil, were we responsible for not doing anything about world poverty? About orphans starving continents away? So one might reasonably convince Alice that no, none of this was her fault.",
  "She didn’t throw them off the Neurath, she didn’t lay the Escher trap, and she didn’t make Peter sacrifice himself.",
  "She’d simply failed to stop it all, and she couldn’t be blamed for that.",
  "",
  "But this reasoning didn’t stand up to intuition.",
  "Alice knew also that in criminal defense, there was a type of argument called “but for.” But for your actions, would this car have crashed? Would this child have drowned? But for Alice Law, would Peter Murdoch be dead? The answer was obviously no.",
  "Alice could draw a straight line from her own stupidity and selfishness to Peter’s sacrifice.",
  "And she knew, if she ever died properly in the world above, if she ever escaped back to the world above, she would end up right back here atoning for the murder of Peter Murdoch’s immortal soul.",
  "But if she was ready to admit this, if she laid it all down on paper, would that be sufficient? Was it enough to declare what she’d done and admit full responsibility for it? Certainly that was too easy, for if so there would not be so many frustrated souls in Dis.",
  "Certainly not all of these souls were deceiving themselves.",
  "Certainly, after decades in this pathetic din, one would prefer to tell the truth.",
  "",
  "But that meant Hell demanded something more than a guilty plea.",
  "That the Furies, or whoever that mysterious they was, if they existed at all, expected a more profound acknowledgment of guilt.",
  "And whatever this was—whether because her mind would not admit it, or because it was out of the grasp of her understanding—Alice was not certain she could ever put it down on paper, or set it to words at all.",
  "",
    "Gradus led her out of the bazaar and into another series of hallways until he stopped before a plain, unmarked door.",
  "“The workshop,” he said, and pushed it open.",
  "Inside was an unadorned room containing one long, oval table, at which sat a dozen or so Shades perched on metal folding chairs—very specifically, the kind of folding chairs with a gap just large enough to frustrate any hope of back support, and rusted metal bolts that threatened to splice you open whenever you tried to fold them up.",

  "Karena tidak seorang pun dari kami di tempat terkutuk ini pernah diberi alasan untuk berharap.”",
  "",
  "“Oh,” kata Alice, dengan suara yang sangat pelan.",
  "“Aku mengerti.”",
  "",
  "Dis tidak terasa begitu mengesankan sekarang.",
  "Keramaian bazar tidak lagi menghibur.",
  "Sekarang kios-kios dan kerumunan itu tampak baginya sebagai pertunjukan yang mengerikan; penuh sesak dan putus asa, hamster-hamster berputar-putar di dalam sangkar berhias yang menyedihkan, semua untuk menghindari satu-satunya pertanyaan yang tampaknya penting: mengapa kau berdosa?",
  "",
  "Bisakah dia menulis jalannya sendiri keluar dari Neraka? Alice bertanya-tanya.",
  "Jika dia entah bagaimana mati secara wajar, jika dia berakhir di Dis.",
  "Bisakah dia menghadapi kertas putih kosong itu dan mengatakan yang sebenarnya?",
  "",
  "Dia tahu apa kejahatan besarnya.",
  "Dia telah membiarkan Peter Murdoch mati.",
  "Dia telah membunuh Peter Murdoch.",
  "",
  "Sekarang, Alice tahu dari percakapan di aula bahwa para filsuf di Cambridge sangat peduli dengan perbedaan antara membunuh dan membiarkan mati.",
  "Beberapa berpendapat bahwa tidak ada perbedaan: bahwa jika kau tahu penyebab kematian dan gagal menghentikannya meskipun kau mampu, maka itu secara moral sama dengan pembunuhan.",
  "Yang lain tidak setuju.",
  "Membiarkan mati mungkin tidak berperasaan secara moral, bantah mereka, tetapi itu berarti menolak untuk terlibat dalam suatu situasi, bukan menyebabkannya.",
  "Jika membiarkan mati begitu jahat, apakah kita bertanggung jawab karena tidak melakukan apa-apa terhadap kemiskinan dunia? Tentang anak-anak yatim piatu yang kelaparan di benua lain? Jadi seseorang mungkin bisa meyakinkan Alice bahwa tidak, semua ini bukan salahnya.",
  "Dia tidak melemparkan mereka dari Neurath, dia tidak memasang perangkap Escher, dan dia tidak membuat Peter mengorbankan dirinya.",
  "Dia hanya gagal menghentikan semuanya, dan dia tidak bisa disalahkan untuk itu.",
  "",
  "Tetapi penalaran ini tidak sesuai dengan intuisi.",
  "Alice juga tahu bahwa dalam pembelaan kriminal, ada jenis argumen yang disebut “jika bukan karena.” Jika bukan karena tindakanmu, apakah mobil ini akan menabrak? Apakah anak ini akan tenggelam? Jika bukan karena Alice Law, apakah Peter Murdoch akan mati? Jawabannya jelas tidak.",
  "Alice bisa menarik garis lurus dari kebodohan dan keegoisannya sendiri ke pengorbanan Peter.",
  "Dan dia tahu, jika dia mati dengan wajar di dunia atas, jika dia berhasil melarikan diri kembali ke dunia atas, dia akan berakhir di sini lagi untuk menebus pembunuhan jiwa abadi Peter Murdoch.",
  "Tetapi jika dia siap untuk mengakui ini, jika dia menuangkan semuanya di atas kertas, apakah itu cukup? Apakah cukup dengan menyatakan apa yang telah dilakukannya dan mengakui tanggung jawab penuh atasnya? Tentu saja itu terlalu mudah, karena jika demikian, tidak akan ada begitu banyak jiwa yang frustrasi di Dis.",
  "Tentu saja tidak semua jiwa ini menipu diri mereka sendiri.",
  "Tentu saja, setelah puluhan tahun dalam hiruk pikuk yang menyedihkan ini, seseorang akan lebih memilih untuk mengatakan yang sebenarnya.",
  "",
  "Tapi itu berarti Neraka menuntut sesuatu yang lebih dari sekadar pengakuan bersalah.",
  "Bahwa Para Erinyes, atau siapa pun 'mereka' yang misterius itu, jika mereka ada, mengharapkan pengakuan bersalah yang lebih mendalam.",
  "Dan apa pun itu—entah karena pikirannya tidak mau mengakuinya, atau karena itu di luar jangkauan pemahamannya—Alice tidak yakin dia bisa menuangkannya di atas kertas, atau mengungkapkannya dengan kata-kata sama sekali.",
  "",
  "Gradus membawanya keluar dari bazar dan masuk ke serangkaian lorong lain sampai dia berhenti di depan pintu polos tak bertanda.",
  "“Lokakarya,” katanya, dan mendorongnya hingga terbuka.",
  "Di dalamnya ada ruangan tanpa hiasan berisi satu meja oval panjang, di mana duduk selusin Arwah di kursi lipat logam—lebih spesifiknya, jenis kursi lipat dengan celah yang cukup besar untuk menghalangi harapan akan sandaran punggung, dan baut logam berkarat yang mengancam akan membelahmu setiap kali kau mencoba melipatnya.",
  "Ruangan itu remang-remang.",
  "Udaranya berbau pesing kucing.",
  "",
  "Sebuah pertemuan sedang berlangsung.",
  "Para Arwah membungkuk di atas beberapa lembar kertas, memperdebatkan sesuatu yang berkaitan dengan “kekerasan dalam rumah tangga” dan “kesalahan moral.”",
  "",
  "Alice mengamati wajah mereka.",
  "Semua ekspresi muram dan fokus.",
  "Alis tebal yang berkerut; mulut terkatup rapat membentuk garis tipis konsentrasi.",
  "Setengahnya memakai kacamata.",
  "Detail pakaian mereka yang lain telah memudar, menyisakan jubah gelap polos, dan ini memberi mereka kesan yang samar-samar bergaya Victoria.",
  "Para Arwah ini tampak siap untuk menguraikan penanda frenologis kecerdasan lintas ras.",
  "Jika ada ruangan di Neraka tempat Grimes seharusnya berada, pikir Alice, di sinilah tempatnya.",
  "Tapi tidak ada wajah yang cocok.",
  "",
  "“Dia tidak ada di sini,” bisiknya pada Gradus.",
  "“Kita harus—”",
  "",
  "Pintu terbanting menutup di belakang mereka.",
  "Pertemuan itu menjadi hening.",
  "Para Arwah mendongak dan menatap.",

  "Sebuah plakat kuningan di depannya bertuliskan, Ketua.",
  "“Lama tidak bertemu denganmu.”",
  "",
  "“Pergi retret,” kata Gradus.",
  "“Perlu menjernihkan pikiran.”",
  "",
  "“Yah, kami tidak akan memberimu komentar,” cibir Arwah di sebelah kiri ketua.",

  "Kau memberi kritik untuk mendapatkan kritik, kau tidak bisa menghilang begitu saja selama bertahun-tahun dan kemudian berharap kami semua membantu—”",
  "",
  "“Tidak apa-apa,” kata Gradus.",

  "“Siapa dia?” tanya ketua.",
  "",
  "Semua mata beralih ke Alice.",
  "",
  "“Darah baru,” kata Gradus.",
  "“Baru saja tiba.”",
  "",
  "“Kukira kita sudah sepakat tidak ada pendatang baru,” kata Arwah di sebelah kiri ketua.",
  "",
  "“Dia masih beradaptasi,” kata Gradus.",
  "“Belum mulai menulis.",
  "Kupikir kalian bisa berbagi sedikit kebijaksanaan.",
  "Tunjukkan padanya bagaimana caranya.”",
  "",
  "“Tapi ini kelompok menulis yang serius,” kata Arwah itu.",
  "“Kami tidak menerima pemula, mereka buang-buang waktu.”",
  "",
  "“Aturannya setidaknya sepuluh tahun,” ketua setuju.",
  "",
  "“Dia pascasarjana Cambridge,” kata Gradus.",
  "“Sihir analitik.”",
  "",
  "Kata Cambridge seperti mantra.",

  "Para Arwah saling berpandangan.",
  "Beberapa mengangkat bahu.",

  "“Kurasa dia bisa mengaudit.",
  "Sebagai uji coba.",
  "Kau boleh duduk di kursi di sudut.”",

  "“Ayo,” kata Gradus pada Alice.",
  "“Duduk.”",
  "",
  "Alice tidak mengerti apa yang masih mereka lakukan di sini.",
  "“Tapi dia tidak—”",
  "",
  "Gradus mendorongnya maju.",
  "“Ketua mempersilakanmu duduk.”",
  "",
  "Alice sadar saat itu bahwa dia tidak memegang kendali di sini.",
  "",
  "Dia bodoh sekali telah memercayai Gradus.",
  "Dia tidak bisa memahami apa yang diinginkannya; seharusnya dia tidak ikut bermain.",
  "Dia tidak mengerti apa yang sedang terjadi sekarang, tetapi dia tidak menyukai kesempatannya sendirian di Dis, jadi dia duduk dengan hati-hati di tepi kursi yang ditunjuk untuknya dan berusaha untuk tidak terlihat terlalu takut.",
  "Gradus tetap berdiri di sampingnya, esensinya mengepul di sekelilingnya seperti sangkar.",

  "“Bisakah kita kembali ke disertasi Profesor Bent?” tanya Arwah bermonokel.",
  "“Jika kita sudah selesai dengan interupsi?”",
  "",
  "“Ya, ya, tentu saja.” Ketua itu duduk kembali.",
  "“Mari kita lanjutkan.",
  "Profesor Brown, tadi Anda bilang . . . ?”",
  "",
  "Profesor Brown mengetuk halaman-halaman di depannya.",
  "“Aku merasa ini agak revisioner.",
  "Nadanya—yah, sangat konfrontatif, bukan?",
  "Dan sanggahan terhadap pembebasan perempuan.",
  "Apa itu tidak sedikit ekstrem?”",
  "",
  "“Aku keberatan,” kata Arwah beberapa kursi dari Profesor Brown.",
  "Alice menduga ini adalah Profesor Bent, penulis disertasi tersebut.",
  "Dia memiliki wajah yang sangat panjang, dan mulut yang terletak sangat jauh di bawah hidungnya, yang tampaknya merupakan hasil alami dari kebiasaan seumur hidup mengelus-elus dagu seperti yang dilakukan Profesor Bent sekarang.",
  "“Ini—sedikit kontrarian, tentu saja, tapi semuanya mengatakan yang sebenarnya.”",
  "",
  "“Kenyataannya adalah semua wanita itu pengomel jahat?”",
  "",
  "“Aku yakin beberapa wanita adalah malaikat yang bajik.” Profesor Bent mendengus.",
  "“Aku tidak akan membuat generalisasi yang ceroboh.",
  "Aku hanya bermaksud mengatakan wanita ini, dalam kasus spesifiknya, mencontohkan semua kelemahan gendernya.",
  "Tidak semua wanita pencemburu, menyebalkan, dan bodoh.",
  "Tapi wanita ini—”",
  "",
  "“Ya, bla, bla, Hawa bagi Adam-mu, sumber segala kejahatan,” sela Arwah lain.",
  "“Itu interpretasi yang membosankan, bukan begitu?",
  "Kau mengecilkan peranmu sendiri dan menjelek-jelekkan istrimu—”",
  "",
  "“Apa yang harus kulakukan?” tuntut Profesor Bent.",
  "“Yang kutulis hanyalah kebenaran, tidak lebih, tidak kurang.",
  "Aku tidak bisa mengarang argumen hanya untuk menyenangkan audiens yang hanya tertarik pada interpretasi feminis.",
  "Aku menolak.",
  "Itu akan menjadi karya ilmiah yang buruk.”",
  "",
  "“Tapi ini sama sekali bukan pengakuan dosa,” kata Arwah bermonokel.",
  "“Ini hanyalah manifesto.”",

  "“Yah, aku tidak punya apa-apa untuk diakui.”",
  "",
  "“Oh, lalu menurutmu kenapa kau ada di Neraka, bodoh?”",
  "",
  "“Sudah, sudah,” kata ketua.",
  "“Mari kita tetap profesional.”",
  "",
  "“Konsep pengakuan dosa itu sangat bergaya Victoria,” kata Profesor Bent.",
  "“Apa kau belum membaca Foucault?",
  "*Science sexualis*.",
  "Pengakuan dosa adalah bentuk diskursif yang represif, di mana tidak ada pengetahuan sejati yang bisa dihasilkan.",
  "Pengakuan dosa adalah tentang rasa malu yang tersembunyi, rasa bersalah, ekstraksi.",
  "Tapi aku tidak akan menjadi tahanan di rak siksa, apa kau mengerti?",
  "Aku tidak akan berbohong demi kebebasan.”",
"",
  "“Aku tidak yakin Para Erinyes telah membaca Foucault,” kata ketua.",
  "“Kau harus mempertimbangkan audiensmu.”",

  "Profesor Bent mendengus.",
  "“Yah, jika para dewa itu sempurna dan maha tahu, maka mereka seharusnya bisa menerima akal sehat.",
  "Para dewa harus mengerti bahwa mode disertasi ini sudah kuno, dan kita tidak mendapat apa-apa dari menyalahkan diri sendiri.",
  "Para dewa seharusnya ingin kita bebas dari represi kita—”",
  "",
  "“Kenapa kita harus membicarakan para dewa?”",
  "",
  "Sesosok Arwah wanita duduk di ujung meja yang berlawanan, kursinya ditarik sedikit ke belakang sehingga dia setengah tersembunyi di balik rekan-rekannya.",
  "Dia mengenakan rambut gelapnya yang diikat sanggul ketat, dan ketika dia mencondongkan tubuh ke depan, Alice melihat dia memiliki wajah yang kaku seperti rubah.",
  "Dia telah berusaha lebih keras untuk membedakan pakaiannya daripada rekan-rekannya.",
  "Dia mengenakan gaun hitam berleher tinggi, kerah putihnya dikanji sangat bersih, setiap lipatan roknya disetrika dengan presisi.",
  "",
  "“Ah, Gertrude,” kata ketua.",
  "“Kau ingin berkontribusi?",
  "Bicaralah lebih keras.”",
  "",
  "Gertrude menggeser kursinya ke belakang dan berdiri.",
  "“Pertanyaanku adalah, siapa yang mau reinkarnasi?”",
  "",
  "“Jangan mulai lagi,” kata Profesor Brown.",
  "“Semua orang ingin dilahirkan kembali, itulah mengapa kita ada di sini.”",
  "",
  "“Apa kau belum membaca *The Republic*?” tuntut Gertrude.",
  "“Apa kau tidak tahu mitos Er?",
  "Ajax menjadi singa.",
  "Odiseus menjadi warga negara biasa.",
  "Tetapi orang jahat tidak punya hak untuk memilih.",
  "Orang jahat menderita di kehidupan selanjutnya.”",
  "",
  "“Kita sudah membahas ini,” kata ketua.",
  "“Kita tidak punya bukti bahwa karma memengaruhi kelahiran kembali—”",
  "",
  "“Ya, kau benar, yang kita miliki hanyalah alasan *a priori*.",
  "Tetapi apa menurutmu hukuman kecil kita ini cukup?",
  "Apa kau benar-benar berpikir, setelah makalah kita dipoles dan diserahkan, bahwa kekuatan yang ada akan menganggap pantas untuk mereinkarnasi kita sebagai bangsawan dan bangsawan wanita?”",
  "",
  "“Sekarang, kita tahu tidak ada jaminan—” ketua memulai.",
  "",
  "“Siapa yang mau jadi cacing tanah?” tuntut Gertrude.",
  "“Siapa yang mau jadi kumbang kotoran?",
  "Atau lebih buruk lagi—dilahirkan dengan kognisi manusia tetapi tidak punya kesempatan untuk menggunakannya.",
  "Secara keseluruhan, penderitaan manusia jauh melebihi kesenangan hidup manusia, dan kita semua hanya beruntung bisa berakhir di tempat kita berada di kehidupan kita sebelumnya.",
  "Tetapi siapa di antara kalian yang bisa beralih dari perumahan kampus ke jalanan?”",
 "",
  "“Itu tidak ada bedanya bagi yang bereinkarnasi,” kata Profesor Bent.",
  "“Kau akan lupa, kau tidak akan punya dasar perbandingan—”",
  "",
  "“Belum lagi melupakan!” seru Gertrude penuh kemenangan.",
  "“Mengapa kita harus ingin ingatan kita dihapus bersih?",
  "Apa bedanya Lethe dengan kematian?",
  "Lebih baik ada seperti kita sekarang, di sini, dan saat ini.",
  "Kita mengikuti teladan Bintang Kejora.",
  "Kita membuat surga kita sendiri di Neraka—”",
  "",
  "“Baiklah, Milton,” kata Profesor Mansfield.",
  "",
  "“Tuhan tidak berkuasa atas kita,” kata Gertrude.",

  "",
  "“Baiklah, Raskolnikov,” kata Profesor Bent.",
  "",
  "“Kalian boleh mengejekku sesuka kalian,” kata Gertrude.",
  "“Tetapi aku percaya Raskolnikov tidak melangkah cukup jauh.",
  "Tekadnya goyah di akhir.",
  "Kesalahannya adalah dia goyah, dia menjadi paranoid, dia membiarkan polisi masuk ke pikirannya.",
"Tapi bayangkan jika dia berpegang pada keyakinannya!",
  "Bayangkan jika si bodoh Sonya, dan semua moralisasi Kristennya, tidak pernah masuk ke dalam cerita—ya, bayangkan jika rasa bersalah tidak pernah menghalanginya . . .”",
  "",
  "“Ya, kami tahu, kami semua sudah membaca Nietzsche, Tuhan sudah mati dan sebagainya,” kata ketua.",
  "“Tapi sayangnya, ada kekuatan yang lebih tinggi yang memutuskan kita pantas mendapatkan hukuman, jadi di sinilah kita—”",
  "",
  "“Tapi tidak harus seperti itu!” Gertrude menggebrak meja dengan telapak tangannya.",
  "“Mengapa kita menerima pengadilan Neraka?",
  "Mengapa kita begitu nyaman dengan situasi kita?",
  "Apa kalian tidak lihat, jika Tuhan belum mati, maka kita harus membunuh Tuhan.",
"Kita harus membangun kembali Neraka sesuai keinginan kita.",

  "“Kenapa dia ada di sini?” Profesor Bent menuntut kepada ketua.",
  "“Ini tidak ada hubungannya dengan disertasiku.”",

  "“Mengapa menghasilkan sebuah karya, jika kau tidak tahu apa yang ingin kau capai dengannya?”",
  "",
  "“Kita di sini untuk membahas metodologi,” kata ketua.",
  "“Bukan metafisika.”",
  "",
  "“Meskipun sepertinya karya ini tidak akan lulus,” kata Arwah bermonokel.",
  "“Kita bahkan belum sampai pada otobiografi yang meragukan—”",
  "",
  "“Hati-hati menyebut meragukan,” kata Profesor Bent.",
  "",
  "“Apa kau benar-benar berpikir perlu dua belas halaman membahas bagaimana keluarga istrimu tidak mau membayar biaya pernikahan?”",

  "",
  "Semuanya memanas begitu cepat.",
  "Sesaat Profesor Bent dan Arwah bermonokel saling berteriak di seberang meja; saat berikutnya mereka sudah bergulat di atasnya.",
  "Setengah dari Arwah berdiri untuk bergabung dalam keributan.",
  "Setengah lainnya duduk santai, lengan terlipat dan cemberut.",
  "Alice menonton, mulutnya ternganga.",
  "Dia merasakan iba yang begitu mendalam.",
  "Mereka begitu peduli, mereka berdebat begitu sengit, tetapi tidak bisakah mereka melihat itu tidak penting, bahkan tidak berarti sama sekali dalam rentang kosmik, dan bahwa ini adalah cara paling bodoh untuk menghabiskan keabadian?",

  "Api menyala di mana pun bara itu mendarat.",
  "Para penjaja bergegas membawa tikar, mencoba memadamkan api.",
  "Tapi mereka sudah terlambat, dan Alice mendengar lolongan saat tumpukan kertas utuh dilalap api.",

  "“Oh—seseorang hentikan mereka!”",
  "",
  "Tetapi dia telah salah mengartikan teriakan mereka sebagai ekspresi penderitaan.",
  "Para Arwah ini merasa senang.",

                  "Gertrude glided, and Alice followed.",
  "During the Italy tour Alice had climbed the steps of the Duomo in Florence, a dreadful idea in the dead of summer, four hundred and sixty-three steps in suffocating heat that she counted one by one in her head, because nothing else in that dim, unventilated, claustrophobic spiral gave her any reason to continue.",
  "One woman suffered something resembling a heart attack halfway up, and the rest of them had to press themselves tight against the wall as she and her husband shuffled, gasping, back down.",
  "Once every hundred stairs there was a tiny window in the stone, and everyone pressed their face against the bars as they walked past, desperate for a breeze.",
  "",
  "Alice could only assume the architect of Dis had been inspired by the Duomo.",
  "But the interstitial windows here afforded no cool air, only small rectangles of Hell’s burnt-orange sky.",
  "Her legs burned; her lungs could not get enough air.",
  "She turned all her efforts on putting one foot in front of another, on ignoring how many there had been and how many there were to go.",
  "At last, just as she feared she might faint, they emerged into a courtyard.",
  "",
  "For a moment Alice thought they had ascended into the living world, for what she saw here mirrored the splendor of Rome, of the Villa Borghese, of Palatine Hill.",
  "These were not ruins, not scattered artifacts fallen through the cracks between worlds, but coherent, elegant designs.",
  "Tiled footpaths arced around sculptures, gazebos, and burbling fountains.",
  "Alice breathed deep, and the air that filled her lungs was crisp, fresh, and sweet.",
  "",
  "“Come along, my dear.” Gertrude gestured for Alice to follow her up the hill.",
  "They reached a terrace lined by statues upon plinths.",
  "A dozen men and women, much larger than life size.",
  "",
  "“The greatest among us,” said Gertrude.",
  "“Our builders and dreamers.",
  "Magicians, architects, and poets among them.",
  "All finely attuned to beauty, and convinced that beauty could be torn away from the divine.”",
  "",
  "Alice tried to guess at the identities of these figures, but there were no names on the plinths, and the chiseled faces were strangely impersonal.",
  "They evoked ideals more than they did particular people.",
  "Uniform strong brows, eyes lifted upward, straight patrician noses.",
  "Mouths set in heroic, defiant frowns.",
  "",
  "“Where are they now?” she asked.",
  "",
  "“Still with us,” said Gertrude.",
  "“This is the Rebel Citadel.",
  "We lose no one to death.”",
  "",
  "They walked across the terrace to an overhang.",
  "Alice leaned over the edge.",
  "She could see all of Dis below—the bazaar, the workshops, the milling interlocutors.",
  "The city was so much larger than she’d imagined.",
  "The bazaar—still burning, wrecked by Cerberus’s rampage—seemed to be only one small pocket of many such marketplaces.",
  "From here she could see a whole teeming mass of Shades, running about the city like ants, all dedicated to the same pointless task.",
  "She stepped back.",
  "It felt good to escape above, free of the noise.",
  "If only she kept away from the edge, she could block the bazaar entirely from view.",
  "From this terrace, the rest of Dis might as well not exist.",

  "For a moment Alice saw what Gertrude saw, looking over that skyline—a great city just becoming, to be filled out and completed over one millennium and then another.",
  "Gertrude spoke as one who had the time; whose existence was not counted in days but in eras; whose project could be measured in one long breath from the birth of the world to its end.",
  "Alice saw flashing in her mind all the outlines of cities that had come before the citadel.",

  "",
  "She had to look.",
  "The Shade landed facedown and did not resist.",
  "For several seconds he floated atop the waters, and then parts of him began melting into the current—bright, swirling colors that unfurled in long, thick streaks.",
  "Alice had visions of a jellyfish, a parachute, a magician's scarf; so many colors emerging from a single point, an endless fount of memories stretching to ten feet, twenty; a cartoon strip of a life laid out for anyone to see, and she was beginning to wonder just how much territory it could cover until at last it all mixed and blurred, then dissolved into the beating black.",

  "Two contradictory impulses swirled inside her then.",

  "She teetered over the edge, and a howling rush came up at her; a violent invisible force that left her skull spinning, her knees weak.",

  "The whole orchard moaned and contracted.",
  "So many faces emerged from the leaves; mouths yawning, eyes blinking open, necks creaking in her direction.",

  "“Doors and windows keep you in,” Alice breathed, and raced forward without stopping.",

  "She passed the laughing Parmenides, who screeched behind her, asking if she'd gotten what she came for; she ran away from Dis until the city was a dwindling point on the horizon, away from the Lethe until the shore was long faded from sight.",
  "She ran until she was alone again on the dunes, under the low-burning sun amidst bleached-white bones, far from the comfort of human structure, from anything that remotely resembled the world above; back into the waste land where the only force that gave sense to anything was her own deteriorating thoughts."

                  "Gertrude melayang, dan Alice mengikutinya.",
  "Selama tur Italia, Alice pernah menaiki tangga Duomo di Florence, ide yang mengerikan di puncak musim panas, empat ratus enam puluh tiga anak tangga dalam panas yang menyesakkan yang dia hitung satu per satu di kepalanya, karena tidak ada hal lain di spiral sempit yang pengap dan klaustrofobik itu yang memberinya alasan untuk melanjutkan.",
  "Seorang wanita mengalami sesuatu yang menyerupai serangan jantung di tengah jalan, dan sisanya harus menempel erat ke dinding saat wanita itu dan suaminya terseok-seok turun kembali sambil terengah-engah.",
  "Setiap seratus anak tangga ada jendela kecil di batu, dan semua orang menempelkan wajah mereka ke jeruji saat melewatinya, putus asa mencari angin sepoi-sepoi.",
  "",
  "Alice hanya bisa berasumsi bahwa arsitek Dis terinspirasi oleh Duomo.",
  "Tetapi jendela-jendela di antara tangga di sini tidak memberikan udara sejuk, hanya persegi panjang kecil dari langit Neraka yang berwarna jingga terbakar.",
  "Kakinya terasa panas; paru-parunya tidak bisa mendapatkan cukup udara.",
  "Dia mengerahkan seluruh upayanya untuk meletakkan satu kaki di depan kaki lainnya, mengabaikan berapa banyak anak tangga yang telah dilewati dan berapa banyak yang masih harus dilalui.",
  "Akhirnya, tepat saat dia takut akan pingsan, mereka muncul di sebuah halaman.",
  "",
  "Sejenak Alice mengira mereka telah naik ke dunia orang hidup, karena apa yang dilihatnya di sini mencerminkan kemegahan Roma, Villa Borghese, Bukit Palatine.",
  "Ini bukanlah reruntuhan, bukan artefak-artefak berserakan yang jatuh melalui celah antar dunia, melainkan desain yang koheren dan elegan.",
  "Jalan setapak berubin melengkung mengitari patung-patung, gazebo, dan air mancur yang bergemericik.",
  "Alice menarik napas dalam-dalam, dan udara yang memenuhi paru-parunya terasa segar, jernih, dan manis.",
  "",
  "“Ayo, Sayang.” Gertrude memberi isyarat agar Alice mengikutinya menaiki bukit.",
  "Mereka mencapai sebuah teras yang diapit oleh patung-patung di atas plin.",
  "Selusin pria dan wanita, jauh lebih besar dari ukuran aslinya.",
  "",
  "“Yang terhebat di antara kita,” kata Gertrude.",

  "Semua sangat peka terhadap keindahan, dan yakin bahwa keindahan bisa dipisahkan dari yang ilahi.”",
  "",
  "Alice mencoba menebak identitas tokoh-tokoh ini, tetapi tidak ada nama di plin, dan wajah-wajah pahatannya anehnya impersonal.",
  "Mereka lebih membangkitkan idealisme daripada orang-orang tertentu.",

  "Kota itu jauh lebih besar dari yang dia bayangkan.",
  "Bazar—masih terbakar, hancur oleh amukan Cerberus—tampaknya hanyalah satu kantong kecil dari banyak pasar serupa.",
  "Dari sini dia bisa melihat kerumunan Arwah yang padat, berlarian di sekitar kota seperti semut, semuanya didedikasikan untuk tugas sia-sia yang sama.",
  "Dia melangkah mundur.",
  "Rasanya menyenangkan bisa melarikan diri ke atas, bebas dari kebisingan.",
  "Andai saja dia menjauh dari tepi, dia bisa menghalangi pemandangan bazar sepenuhnya.",

  "Di bawahnya bergolak Sungai Lethe, hitam dan tanpa ampun.",
  "Di sini sungai itu lebih bergejolak daripada yang pernah dilihat Alice, menghantam bebatuan di bawahnya dengan ganas.",
  "Di sini lebih dari tempat lain, Lethe tampak bukan seperti sungai melainkan lautan, hamparan hitam luas yang mengelilingi mereka di semua sisi.",
  "Dia menatap ke cakrawala, bertanya-tanya—tetapi dia tidak melihat apa-apa di sana.",
  "Wilayah kekuasaan Raja Yama tetap tersembunyi dari pandangan.",
  "",
  "“Kami membangun di tepi air,” kata Gertrude.",
  "“Bantahan terbesar.”",
  "",
  "Dengan bangga dia mengamati wilayah kekuasaannya.",
  "Alice mengikuti pandangannya, mengagumi siluet kompleks itu, menara-menara yang menjulang menantang ke langit.",

  "",
  "“Oh,” kata Alice.",
  "",
  "“Pernah terjadi gempa yang paling dahsyat, dan menara lonceng runtuh.” Gertrude menggelengkan kepalanya.",
  "“Bencana yang luar biasa.",
  "Kami menyaksikannya runtuh menuruni bebatuan, berdentang sepanjang waktu, dan tenggelam di bawah ombak.",
  "Masih terkadang kami mendengar nada rendah, berdengung di tulang kami, dan kami tahu itu adalah lonceng yang berdentang dari bawah Lethe, masih berdentang.”",
  "",

  "Kami sedang membangun sesuatu yang lebih baik.”",
  "",
  "Sejenak Alice melihat apa yang dilihat Gertrude, memandangi kaki langit itu—sebuah kota besar yang baru mulai terbentuk, untuk diisi dan diselesaikan selama satu milenium dan kemudian milenium berikutnya.",
  "Gertrude berbicara sebagai orang yang punya waktu; yang keberadaannya tidak dihitung dalam hari tetapi dalam era; yang proyeknya bisa diukur dalam satu napas panjang dari kelahiran dunia hingga akhirnya.",
  "Alice melihat berkelebat di benaknya semua garis besar kota yang telah ada sebelum benteng itu.",
  "Roma, Yerusalem, Aleksandria, Xi'an—semua pusat besar dunia, tempat-tempat yang telah dilampaui usianya oleh Benteng Pemberontak.",
  "Dia mencoba membayangkan Dis dari sudut pandang waktu yang panjang itu.",
  "Mungkin pada waktunya Dis akan tumbuh begitu besar, begitu ramah, sehingga tidak ada jiwa yang akan menyeberang.",
  "Mengapa bekerja keras, jika kau bisa beristirahat dengan damai?",
  "",
  "Gertrude menoleh ke cakrawala.",
  "Dalam cahaya yang membakar, profilnya cukup mencolok.",

  "Alice telah salah besar mengiranya sebagai seorang bidah.",
  "Di sini, Gertrude lebih menempati peran seorang santa.",
  "",
  "“Pernahkah kau melihat pasir jatuh melalui jam pasir?” tanya Gertrude.",
  "“Bayangkan sekarang, di mata pikiranmu.",
  "Perhatikan apa yang terjadi di bagian bawah.",
  "Pasir selalu membentuk puncak kecil.",
  "Sebuah gunung, menjulang.",
  "Kemudian bebannya menjadi terlalu besar, dan pasir runtuh ke luar, dan bagian bawahnya rata kembali.",
  "Waktu tidak membangun menuju klimaks, kau tahu.",
  "Hanya puncak kecil, selalu hampir runtuh.",
  "Begitulah cara waktu bergerak di sini di Dis.",
  "Dorongan-dorongan kecil ke depan, ilusi pembangunan.",
  "Kemudian siklus berulang, lagi dan lagi, sementara sepanjang waktu bagian bawah terakumulasi.",
  "Suatu hari kita akan mencapai puncak.",
  "Tetapi itu membutuhkan waktu yang sangat lama.”",
  "",
  "Dia mengangkat dagunya.",
  "“Kita akan ada di sini pada akhirnya.",
  "Kita akan ada di sini ketika matahari yang sekarat padam.",
  "Ketika pasukan Gog dan Magog berkumpul untuk menyerbu para santo Surga, ketika Fenrir menelan Odin utuh, ketika Apep melahap Ra dan melemparkan segalanya ke dalam kegelapan, ketika dunia terbalik dan keraknya dilemparkan ke dalam batu cair untuk dilahirkan kembali, kita akan ada di sini.”",
  "",
  "Dia berbicara dengan keyakinan seperti itu.",
  "",
  "Alice bertanya-tanya apa yang diperlukan untuk mempertahankan harapan itu selama bertahun-tahun, selama berabad-abad.",
  "Kemudian dia bertanya-tanya di mana letak cacat dalam pemikiran Gertrude.",
  "Apakah memang ada?",
  "Karena di dunia di mana tidak ada aturan yang stabil, mengapa tidak percaya pada pembalikan apokaliptik tatanan moral?",
  "Mengapa itu begitu tidak mungkin?",
  "Bukankah ada keindahan yang aneh dalam semua itu?",
  "Keyakinan apa—untuk berbuat salah dan mempertahankannya—betapa jauh lebih berani daripada berbuat benar hanya karena takut.",
  "Saat itu Alice iri pada Gertrude.",
  "Setidaknya Gertrude tahu apa yang dia perjuangkan.",
  "Setidaknya Gertrude punya masa depan untuk diperjuangkan, sejauh apa pun itu.",
  "",
  "“Dan aku bisa saja . . .” Alice merentangkan tangannya, tidak yakin bagaimana harus bersikap.",

  "“Dan tidak ada orang lain yang bisa masuk?”",

  "“Dan jika aku ingin pergi?”",

  "“Aku tidak akan memaksamu untuk tinggal.",

  "Dengan lembut, Gertrude menekan tangannya ke punggung Alice.",
  "“Pergilah.",
  "Kota ini milikmu.”",
  "",
  "Ini tampak agak mendadak bagi Alice.",
  "Dia tidak tahu kemeriahan apa lagi yang mungkin dia inginkan—Gertrude telah memberikan tepat seperti yang dia janjikan—tetapi dia tidak menyangka akan diusir begitu cepat.",
  "",
  "“Tapi di mana semua orang?”",
  "",
  "“Beristirahat.",
  "Orang-orang datang ke benteng untuk mencari ketenangan.",
  "Kami tidak bertengkar seperti mereka yang di bawah.",
  "Berkeliaranlah sesukamu, tetapi pada waktunya kau akan menyadari bahwa kau juga lebih menyukai ketenangan.”",

  "Jadi Alice berjalan menyusuri jalan marmer, merasa sedikit seperti anak kecil yang disuruh tidur sebelum matahari terbenam.",
  "",
  "Dia menghabiskan beberapa waktu menatap patung-patung itu, tetapi kesempurnaan halus mereka menjadi membosankan dalam waktu singkat.",
  "Mereka hanya menginspirasi dari kejauhan; dari dekat, semua wajah mereka tampak sama.",
  "Florence terasa menarik dengan cara yang tidak dimiliki tempat ini, pikirnya.",
  "Florence bertekstur.",
  "Tidak ada di sini yang memiliki sejarah.",
  "Tidak ada yang retak atau mengkilap karena waktu.",
  "Semuanya dibangun dan diperbaiki serta dipelihara terus-menerus sehingga keabadian entah bagaimana tampak hanya berusia satu dekade.",
  "",
  "Dia merasa sedikit kecewa, jujur saja.",
  "Nama Benteng Pemberontak menjanjikan sesuatu yang lebih—idealnya, sesuatu yang memberontak—tetapi sebagian besar hanya tampak sunyi.",
  "Di mana para Lucifer?",
  "",
  "Dia berjalan lebih jauh menyusuri jalan setapak yang sunyi, sedikit penasaran untuk melihat di mana dia akan berakhir.",
  "Dia tidak bisa memahami desain benteng itu.",
  "Itu bukan spiral atau sarang lebah atau hamparan sederhana di bukit, tetapi entah bagaimana ketiganya sekaligus.",
  "Itu melengkung ke dalam dirinya sendiri; jalan setapak yang sama yang merayap turun di bagian dalamnya juga melingkar di sekitar bagian luarnya.",
  "Beberapa kali dia melewati dinding-dinding tinggi yang gelap, yakin dia berada jauh di dalam perut kota, hanya untuk muncul secara tak terduga ke sebuah teras.",
  "Di luar, dari semua sudut, benteng itu tampak kosong dan indah—jadi di mana rahasianya?",
  "Alice menetapkan prinsip sewenang-wenang untuk dirinya sendiri—selalu berbelok ke arah kegelapan—dan ini membawanya ke labirin padat alun-alun yang sangat mirip dengan matriks lorong-lorong dan *campo* berdinding di Venesia.",

  "Arsip menjanjikan mekar yang mempesona, vitalitas yang seharusnya tidak ada.",
  "Tetapi cabang ini adalah benda layu berwarna cokelat kehitaman, menjulur lemas dari semak yang mengering.",
  "Ketika Alice menyentuhnya dengan ujung jarinya, cabang itu menyusut seperti cacing dari garam.",

  "Sesuatu seperti Tidak, pergi, biarkan aku sendiri.",

  "“Apa-apaan ini?” gumamnya.",
  "",
  "Dia menyentuh cabang itu lagi.",
  "Dan meskipun cabang itu menyusut lebih jauh, Alice mendengar suara itu lebih jelas kali ini—suara yang koheren sekarang, sepatah kata yang hampir tidak bisa dia pahami, jika dia bisa menguraikan bahasanya.",
  "Dia menahan jarinya di cabang itu, dan pusaran bisikan merembes melalui udara.",
  "",
  "Dia menajamkan telinganya.",
  "Tolong biarkan itu hantu, pikirnya, tolong beri aku teman, siapa saja.",

  "“Tidak—” teriak Alice, tapi sudah terlambat.",

  "Alice mendapat bayangan ubur-ubur, parasut, syal pesulap; begitu banyak warna muncul dari satu titik, sumber ingatan tak berujung yang membentang hingga sepuluh kaki, dua puluh; strip kartun kehidupan terhampar untuk dilihat siapa saja, dan dia mulai bertanya-tanya seberapa banyak wilayah yang bisa dicakupnya sampai akhirnya semuanya bercampur dan kabur, lalu larut ke dalam kegelapan yang berdenyut.",
  "Kemudian permukaan obsidian Lethe sama seperti sebelumnya.",

  "Kedua, baru sekarang dia menyadari betapa dia tidak ingin mati.",
  "",
  "Dia terhuyung di tepi, dan deru lolongan mendatanginya; kekuatan tak terlihat yang kejam yang membuat tengkoraknya berputar, lututnya lemas.",
  "Bukan aku, pikirnya; bukan aku, tidak sekarang, belum, tidak seperti ini.",
  "Darah bergemuruh di telinganya, dan tidak berhenti sampai dia terhuyung kembali ke tempat aman.",
  "",
  "Dia terhuyung dan berpaling.",
  "Dia mendapati semua pohon di benteng itu membungkuk ke arahnya.",
  "Semua kedengkian jiwa-jiwa yang tak terhitung jumlahnya terfokus pada satu titik.",
  "Dalam satu suara mereka berkata, Duri.",
  "",
  "Alice berlari.",
  "",
  "Dia tidak ingin menuju ke hutan tetapi dia harus menjauh dari tebing, dan ini hanya menyisakan jalan beraspal melalui pusat *campo*.",
  "Hutan itu melolong dan berkumpul di sekelilingnya—daun-daun menjangkau, cabang-cabang melengkung.",

  "Sulur-sulur terentang, tetapi Alice menepisnya.",
  "Dia melepaskan diri dari halaman dan berlari menyusuri jalan marmer.",
  "Dia samar-samar menyadari Gertrude menjerit di atasnya tetapi tidak berhenti untuk melihat.",
  "Dia berlari melintasi teras, melewati patung-patung dan air mancur, dan kembali ke tangga sempit.",

  "",
  "Tapi ini trik lama!",
  "Alice mencapai dinding, melihat konstruksinya yang halus, dan hampir menjerit karena tawa.",
  "Jika para penyihir membangun tempat ini, maka para penyihir masih menceritakan lelucon yang sama.",
  "Dia tahu persis bagaimana kelanjutannya, bisa mengucapkannya dengan irama persis seperti mahasiswa tahun pertama yang menceritakannya untuk pertama kali di pub.",
  "Ludwig Wittgenstein pernah berpendapat tidak ada masalah filosofis, hanya masalah bahasa.",
  "Apa itu pintu dan jendela?",
  "",
  "“Pintu dan jendela menahanmu di dalam,” Alice menghela napas, dan berlari maju tanpa henti.",
  "Dia bahkan tidak perlu menggambar pentagram untuk ini, ilusinya begitu tipis.",

  "",
  "Dia tidak berhenti di situ.",
  "Dia berlari melewati bazar, melewati para penjaja dan skeptis serta orang percaya.",
  "Melewati Iblis Laplace dan naskah-naskah yang tercabik-cabik.",
  "Melewati Cerberus yang melolong dan mayat-mayat di belakangnya; melewati gerbang-gerbang besar itu, karena tidak ada penjaga di dalam, dan pintu-pintu terbuka dengan mudah ketika dia mendorongnya.",
  "Dia melewati Parmenides yang tertawa, yang menjerit di belakangnya, bertanya apakah dia mendapatkan apa yang dicarinya; dia berlari menjauh dari Dis sampai kota itu menjadi titik yang menyusut di cakrawala, menjauh dari Lethe sampai pantai sudah lama memudar dari pandangan.",
  "Dia berlari sampai dia sendirian lagi di bukit pasir, di bawah matahari yang membakar rendah di tengah tulang-tulang putih pucat, jauh dari kenyamanan struktur manusia, dari apa pun yang sedikit pun menyerupai dunia atas; kembali ke tanah terlantar di mana satu-satunya kekuatan yang memberi makna pada apa pun adalah pikirannya sendiri yang memburuk."

  "She could not see its faint black outline on the horizon, nor hear its waves crashing against the rocks.",
  "Until now Hell had been always bounded at least on one side, and now it was not.",
  "No matter which map was right—Peter's spiral/pizza/anus, her linear progressive map—the Lethe was the only limit on infinity.",
  "And in both Euclidean and hyperbolic space, a line that once intersected another would never intersect it again.",

  "The grounds shifted far more rapidly than the earlier courts, and every time she glanced up she was somewhere new.",
  "A ring of cacti became a ring of rocks; a hill in the distance became, at second glance, a valley.",

  "She found she didn't get hungry or thirsty anymore.",
  "When she did eat she felt nourished, but otherwise, her body felt theoretical.",
  "Her metabolism must have slowed; she hardly registered her need.",
  "Perhaps her body was stilling to match the rhythm of Hell, where change was counted in not hours but ages.",
  "In her mind's eye she saw herself whittled down until she was hard and gleaming like the incomprehensible skeletons that littered the plane.",
  "",
  "Here was a riddle: If nothing lived in Hell, then how was it that bones were stripped bare?",
  "For it was hawks and buzzards, nibbling crawling bugs, that made skeletons gleam so on earth.",
  "Death was scrubbed clean because life went on; rot and decomposition were growth; the cycles begot one another, so how did death polish itself in these wastelands, where time stood still?",
  "Boundaries are porous, she thought.",

  "And that became the resting place for all souls, from the beginning of time until now, until a spark of life formed on the other side—and the seeds of life began to sprout.",

  "Dan darah kucing itu begitu kaya dan segar, kapur itu menulis begitu bersih, hanya butuh beberapa detik baginya untuk menulis dalam bahasa matematika apa yang setara dengan pernyataan, Tapi ada kalkulus.",
  "",
  "Kakinya terbebas.",
  "Alice melompat dan berguling ke samping, tepat saat bilah-bilah itu bersiul turun mengenai kehampaan.",
  "",
  "Ketika dia sadar, ketika kepanikannya mereda dan denyut nadinya melambat, dia sangat lapar.",
  "",
  "Darah binatang itu penyebabnya.",
  "Bau amisnya memenuhi udara; musky, asin, lezat.",
  "Dia merangkak berlutut, dan setelah dia melemparkan jari-jarinya ke pasir dan menonaktifkan perangkap itu untuk selamanya, dia menekan wajahnya ke bangkai itu dan mengerang.",
  "",
  "Dia tidak bisa merasa cukup.",
  "Bukan hanya darah dan kehangatan yang tersisa; itu adalah kekotoran bangkai itu sendiri.",
  "Dia sudah lama tidak berada di sekitar begitu banyak jeroan hidup, komponen kehidupan yang lembap dan licin.",
  "Neraka membuat indra kelaparan.",
  "Semuanya begitu bersih dan sunyi di sini, begitu steril; tetapi bau amis kucing itu adalah bukti bahwa kehidupan itu berantakan, penuh darah dan usus dan tulang rawan.",
  "Dekomposisi berarti kehidupan.",
  "Dia ingin berguling-guling dalam kekacauan itu; dia memiliki keinginan yang luar biasa untuk menuangkan seember di atas kepalanya, mengoleskan darah itu ke seluruh wajah dan lengannya, dan bergulat dengan bangkai itu sampai mereka menjadi satu.",
  "",
  "Akal sehat menang.",
  "Dia mulai membuat api.",
  "",
  "Dia punya segenggam korek api yang masih kering, dan halaman buku catatannya menjadi kayu bakar yang bagus.",
  "Dalam waktu singkat dia memiliki nyala api yang stabil.",
  "Dia melepaskan ikatan pisau Kripkes dari katrolnya dan menggergaji sisi kucing itu sampai dia mendapatkan beberapa genggam daging.",
  "Dia menggali lebih dalam, dan menemukan apa yang tampak seperti jantung dan hati.",
  "Organ itu sehat, dia pernah membaca; makan itu dulu.",
  "Semua ini dia tusuk dengan pisau dan letakkan langsung ke dalam api.",
  "Biarkan terbakar; dia tidak peduli.",
  "Dia menginginkannya berantakan; arang dan darah dan semuanya.",
  "Dia tidak bisa menunggu cukup lama sampai dagingnya matang.",
  "Begitu baunya mencapai hidungnya, perutnya menjerit, dan dia melihat dirinya di mata pikirannya dengan tatapan lapar yang sama seperti yang pernah diarahkan kucing itu padanya.",
  "Dia merebut daging itu.",
  "Daging itu membakar jari-jarinya; dia tidak menyadarinya.",
  "Hatinya dia makan dengan cepat.",
  "Daging itu hancur lembut di giginya.",
  "Jantungnya dia kunyah lama sekali, menikmati betapa sakitnya gusinya.",
  "Rasa tidak penting, dia hampir tidak menyadarinya; yang penting hanyalah bahan kimia di ususnya bisa tahu itu adalah materi biologis kaya nutrisi dan itu bagus.",
  "",
  "Saat itu sisa dagingnya sudah matang, semua lemak berderak yang menggoda, tetapi perut Alice bergejolak membayangkan memasukkan lebih banyak ke dalamnya.",
  "Dia berbaring telentang dan menatap langit dengan linglung.",
  "",
  "Sungguh perjalanan.",
  "",
  "Dia ingin sekali memiliki kemewahan mengalami gangguan mental tetapi sayangnya, sekarang waktu penting lagi.",
  "Dia terlempar kembali ke skema perubahan dan sekarang ada momentum ke depan, tujuan, hal-hal yang harus dilakukan dan diselesaikan.",
  "Dia harus menyibukkan diri dengan apa pun yang terjadi beberapa jam dari sekarang.",
  "Masa depan!",
  "Sungguh sebuah konsep.",
  "",
  "Begitu indranya kembali sedikit, dia mengamati bangkai yang terhampar.",
  "Dia menduga dia bisa lebih berhati-hati dalam memotong daging—organ, darah, dan daging berserakan di pasir, dan pada tahap ini dia kesulitan membedakan mana yang mana—tetapi dia masih bisa menyelamatkan seluruh potongan daging dari sisi dan kaki kucing itu.",
  "Dia tidak tahu apa-apa tentang mengawetkan daging, tetapi dia pikir daging matang akan bertahan lebih lama daripada mentah.",
  "Bekal untuk masa depan.",
  "Sebuah masa depan.",
  "Luar biasa.",
  "Dia memanggang daging menggunakan pisau sebagai tusuk sate, menatap lekat-lekat saat daging berderak berubah dari merah terang menjadi hitam pekat.",
  "Baunya membuatnya lapar sekali lagi.",
  "Dia merobek daging itu menjadi potongan-potongan dan makan dengan lahap, menjilati lemak dari jari-jari yang terbakar.",
  "",
  "Untuk pertama kalinya dalam waktu yang lama, dia merasakan tubuhnya.",
  "Dia merasakan keinginan dan rasa sakitnya.",
  "Dia merasakan kekuatannya.",
  "Dia membalikkan tangan kanannya di depan matanya dan menatap, terkejut, pada tonjolan dan pembuluh darahnya.",
  "Begitu banyak potongan kecil yang berputar menyusun gumpalan mesin yang berat ini.",
  "Dan keajaiban dari semua keajaiban, itu bekerja.",
  "",
  "Dia merasakan sesuatu yang lain: deru berdenyut jauh di lubuk perutnya.",
  "Dia tidak bisa menggambarkannya dengan tepat.",
  "Itu bukan sensasi yang pernah dia rasakan sebelumnya; memang intensitasnya agak membuatnya takut.",
  "Tetapi pada saat itu, yang Alice tahu hanyalah dia sangat ingin membunuh sesuatu."

  "Thurification, thought Alice.",
  "That was the English word.",
  "She thought to little sacrifices her parents laid out during festivals; offerings to their ancestral dead alongside slow-burning incense.",
  "So this was what happened on the other side, she realized.",
  "Ghosts plunging their heads in thick, hot food.",
  "Next time I’ll dispense with the incense, she told herself, and just toss the food in the flames.",

  "He raised his head.",
  "She giggled; his face was half blurred with smoke; half smeared and dripping, in imitation of a man at a barbecue with no bib.",
  "He’d surely put on this effect to amuse her, and this pleased her; it meant they were still something to one another.",
  "",

  "He shrugged.",
  "“Of course you went.",

  "I helped build it.",
  "I have spent countless years at Gertrude’s side, planning our expanding skyline.",
  "I have been a tree in that courtyard, still, and almost disappeared.",
  "I have been a pacing soul in the gardens, treading the same steps over and over again.”",
  "Gradus bent back over the fire and sucked in another long, satisfying drag.",
  "He sighed.",
  "“And I have teetered over the rocks, watching the waves, daring myself to jump.”",

  "“Because the temptation was too great.",

  "“I don’t know how to move on, and I don’t want to die.",
  "Time allows no exit, and it all boils down to one of two choices: end it for good or keep going.",
  "Now, the former seems more elegant, and certainly it’s more rational.",
  "A clean end compared to infinite suffering.",
  "But then why aren’t we lining up to jump?",
  "It can’t just be fear, you see.",
  "Fear expires.",
  "Even the most acute terrors erode over time.",
  "I used to cower from those crashing waves and now, I don’t even flinch.",
  "I watch others jump, all the time, and their unraveling does not scare me, I do not look away.",
  "But still I do not jump.",
  "I cannot.",
  "Something deep within me refuses.",
  "Why is that?",
  "So now you understand the problem.”",
  "His tone grew urgent.",

  "She would be frustrated too, if she’d wandered this wasteland trapped by two bad options, and along pranced some idiot who declared it didn’t all matter.",
  "",
  "“I just wish,” said Gradus, “I could find some way out.”",
  "",
  "Alice racked her mind for consolation, and couldn’t find it.",
  "In the whole of chthonic literature there was nothing on this fundamental problem, there were only varied and detailed accounts of never-ending despair.",
  "No one was much interested in how souls got out of Hell.",
  "She could only settle on Dante’s answer, the only possibility of salvation in the entire Inferno.",
  "Only one being could harrow Hell.",

  "She knew what she was meant to do.",
  "She could not change the past, could not take back her murder, could not keep wallowing in her guilt, could not bring Peter back.",
  "But she could make her death mean something—she might do something to end this terrible cycle, and even if this ended with her bloodless on the silt, that might be enough.",

  "",
  "It was the strangest thing.",
  "Here she was marching to her almost certain death, and it was the first time in a long time that she felt her life mattered.",
  "This urgency, this rush—like all of her, body and soul, was pointed like an arrow, taut with purpose.",
  "Something better than anger, despair, or vengeance.",
  "She could feel her heart beating, the blood coursing through her veins, from her heart to her fingertips, clenched tight around her blades.",
  "When she spilled it, it would matter.",
  "",
  "How much time had she wasted wandering around in a fog?",
  "Looking back now it made her want to scream.",
  "No, she did not want to fade into those churning depths.",
  "Refused to petrify into comatose forest.",
  "She wanted to crash brilliantly against something, and when she went she wanted to leave a mark.",

  "Alice dragged herself over to the cat and set about dismembering it.",
  "",
  "You could do quite a lot with bones, it turned out.",
  "Alice extracted all the spiky bits—claws, vertebrae, the end of its tail—and gathered them in a handkerchief.",
  "She reasoned she could clutch them in her knuckles and, in a pinch, gouge at cheeks or eyes.",
  "The cat’s femurs were long and hard.",
  "She bashed them against a rock and found herself with a set of makeshift daggers.",
  "Delighted, she weighed them in her hands.",
  "They were lighter than her knives and better fit her grip.",
  "",
  "Now for armor.",
  "It took some finagling, but at last she managed to extract the cat’s rib cage intact and slide it on over her own torso.",
  "It was surprisingly light.",
  "She tapped it a few times with her knife, and the bones felt sturdy enough.",
  "It wouldn’t stop a blade piercing her heart, but it would ward off glancing blows.",
  "",
  "“Ooh,” said Gradus.",
  "“Terrifying.”",
  "",
  "Alice preened.",
  "",
  "The only item she couldn’t use was the skull.",
  "She spent nearly an hour digging the eyes and brains out with her fingers, though once she’d cleaned off the skull she couldn’t pry it unhinged or fit it in a way that made sense as a helmet.",
  "Her head simply wouldn’t fit.",
  "Pity, she thought; it looked very cool.",
  "",
  "Instead she made a little mound with the dirt, arranged some pebbles in a neat circle, and placed the skull on top.",
  "She even inscribed a bit of magick to keep the mound intact.",
  "Just a tiny ward that stilled change.",
  "It wouldn’t keep someone from kicking it over, but it would protect against the little erosions of time.",
  "Wind blowing, rodents scurrying.",
  "",
  "She sat back, satisfied.",
  "There, she thought.",
  "She’d made her own contribution to the map of madness.",
  "Years might pass and the cat’s skull might still be here, those massive sockets leering at all those who passed.",
  "Let it bedevil the next sojourner who came through, demanding interpretation.",
  "She bowed low to the little shrine, since she felt the cat deserved some of her gratitude, and then tapped it on the forehead.",
  "“Remember me, won’t you?",
  "Even if they gut me like a pig.”",
  "",
  "“You don’t have to fight them,” said Gradus.",
  "",
  "“What’s that?”",
  "",
  "His voice was hardly a mumble.",

  "“Are you trying to get me to run?”",

  "Gradus would not meet her eye.",

  "“Your odds are terrible.”",
  "",
  "“I know.”",
  "",
  "“The Kripkes are practiced killers.",
  "You are a mouse.",

  "Alice knew better than to imagine he cared.",
  "Probably he regarded her the way one regarded a toy kitten.",
  "Oh, please don’t run into the street.",
  "We still have games to play.",
  "Still, this was the first time in a while that anyone had expressed concern over her demise, and she was dearly touched.",
  "",
  "“I wish I could give you a hundred years of memories, John Gradus.”",
  "She made a gesture toward the mist.",
  "He shrank away; shy, or startled, or both.",
  "“But that would take no sand out of the hourglass.",
  "We’d only be delaying the inevitable.”",
  "",
  "He sounded peevish.",
  "“But at least you’d still be here.”",
  "",
  "“If I die, I die,” said Alice.",
  "“But there’s no life otherwise, I think.",
  "Life is an activity that’s got to be sustained.",
  "You have to fight for it.",
  "Otherwise it’s no life at all.",
  "That’s just it.",
  "It’s just an impulse.",

  "It was a long-running joke at Cambridge that snorting chalk imbued you with all the magical potential energy of long-dead sea creatures.",
  "But magick chalk was also an academy-restricted substance shown to deteriorate human tissue upon ingestion, and improper use could get you a lifetime ban from practicing magick, so despite all the jokes at the pub, no one had ever tried it.",

  "“Where I’m from they cut it with a penknife,” said Gradus.",

  "Alice was trying to crush it with the base of her palm, but all that did was leave dents in her flesh.",
  "“Stop mocking me.”",
  "",
  "“Just try it.”",
  "",
  "Alice had lost the penknife, so she tried the dagger instead.",
  "It took a bit of experimenting but she did manage by alternating the dull and sharp sides to cut the chalk into pieces that wouldn’t choke her.",
  "When it seemed sufficiently pulverized, she gathered it into a neat little pile in her palm.",
  "Then she leaned over and huffed.",
  "",
  "The effect was immediate.",
  "She felt like she’d stuffed wasabi up her nostrils.",
  "Sharp stabs of pain spread through her nose into her skull.",
  "Tears welled at her eyes.",
  "She reeled back, clutching her temples, just as spots of color exploded in her mind.",
  "A cacophony of memories, memories she didn’t even know she had—memories she still couldn’t place, entirely foreign except for their intensity.",
  "A woman laughing.",
  "A deer startling.",
  "A giant’s stride.",
  "A midnight streak into the lake, and the plunging cold.",
  "All the axioms in the world swirling and dancing above her.",
  "Here was the hidden world revealed and written clear; no shadows, no veils.",

  "Keterdesakan ini, gejolak ini—seperti seluruh dirinya, tubuh dan jiwa, diarahkan seperti anak panah, tegang dengan tujuan.",
  "Sesuatu yang lebih baik daripada kemarahan, keputusasaan, atau balas dendam.",

  "Satu-satunya barang yang tidak bisa dia gunakan adalah tengkoraknya.",

            original: [
                  "Alice was no wartime magician, but all the military histories she'd ever read made a big deal about finding the high ground.",
  "So she tracked first to the river, and then she found a spot on a bluff where she could see the Kripkes coming from all directions.",
  "This bluff stretched into jagged overhangs that loomed above Lethe, and so she formulated a plan: to lure the Kripkes to the top and find some way of tricking them over the edge.",
  "The drop was not far, but she didn't need the fall to kill.",
  "She only needed to get them wet.",
  "",
  "Then she roved the surrounding hills with a bucket of cat's blood, dipping and drawing pentagrams on every spare inch of sand she could find.",
  "",
  "This work was quite calming.",
  "It gave her somewhere to focus her chalk-screaming mind.",
  "Always it was so lovely to have a well-defined objective and clear parameters for success.",
  "In her college years Alice had participated in several Magick Olympiads, in which contestants were given half an hour to inscribe pentagrams to accomplish a series of tasks.",
  "Make the bowling ball rise to the ceiling.",
  "Move this pin from one end of a field to the next.",
  "She'd racked up a half dozen medals for her talent in inscribing quickly and accurately under pressure.",
  "The old thrill of competition came back to her now.",
  "Forget the Kripkes for a moment, forget the likelihood of impending death, and win the game at hand.",
  "Here is a board, and here is your objective: to obstruct your opponents more than they obstruct you.",
  "",
  "She pulled out the standard repertoire.",
  "At intervals across the field she inscribed all of Zeno's paradoxes of motion: Achilles and the tortoise, Atalanta on the racetrack, the arrow in flight.",
  "If Atalanta wished to cross a racetrack—if the bone-things wished to cross the field to the bluff—she had to first get halfway there, and then halfway to halfway there, and then halfway to halfway to halfway there.",
  "But if you kept dividing the distances by half, then Atalanta had to accomplish an infinite number of tasks, and so she probably couldn't budge at all.",
  "And if the bone-things wished to even move—if they, like an arrow, wished to traverse space from point A to point B—they must grapple with the fact that at any given moment in time, if you took a freeze frame of their movements, they would be standing still.",
  "The time it would take them to reach Alice was composed of such given moments, but that meant they were always standing still, and never moving.",
  "And they could never harm Alice if they could not move.",
  "",
  "This was all silly stuff, as long as you had beginner calculus.",
  "But the bone-things did not have calculus.",
  "",
  "Where the ground sloped toward the hill, Alice wrote out an expanded version of the Liar Paradox.",
  "This was a practical joke within the department that often had undergraduates stepping back and forth on the stairways, stuck like rocking horses:",
  "",
  "THE NEXT STATEMENT IS FALSE",
  "THE PRECEDING STATEMENT IS TRUE",
  "",
  "At the top of the mound, right against the ledge, she drew from memory a most special paradox.",
  "She had no clue whether this one would work, but she didn't strictly need it to work.",
  "She only needed to show Nick and Magnolia something they'd never seen before.",
  "Something interesting enough to give them pause.",
  "",
  "“You seem very prepared.” Gradus had been drifting at her heels as she worked, murmuring in appreciation all the while.",
  "",
  "“You could help me fight them,” said Alice.",
  "",
  "“What, and huff and puff until they all blow down?” Gradus blurred himself all over, as if to emphasize his insubstantiality.",
  "“I'm only a Shade, remember.”",
  "",
  "“I'm sure you're good for lots of things,” said Alice.",
  "“You could distract them, for instance.",
  "You could swoop and billow and yell very loudly.”",
  "",
  "But she could tell she had overestimated the strength of their bond.",
  "Gradus was fond of her only when it was amusing to be.",
  "And while she considered their time together very special, she was only a fraction of his deep time.",
  "In one thousand years he would likely only chuckle at her name.",
  "",
  "“Ah . . . well.” Gradus made the sound of a throat clearing.",
  "She thought Gradus might say something more.",
  "For a moment it really did seem like he was considering it.",
  "But it was so much less awkward not to.",
  "Goodbyes were worth the effort only when you meant to see someone again.",
  "Gradus merely dissolved where he stood, solid grays fading to a shadow.",
  "There was a slight breeze, then he was gone.",
  "And Alice might have felt abandoned, but she thought about it for a moment, and then concluded she didn't have any real grounds to be upset.",
  "",
  "Humming, she returned to her work.",
  "",
  "She checked all her pentagrams, made sure all the circles were closed.",
  "She sprinkled sand across her handiwork, enough to hide it from a casual glance, not enough to interfere with the pentagrams' range.",
  "She stood back, surveyed the now-smooth terrain, and nodded in satisfaction.",
  "She had laid a very good chessboard.",
  "It was the best anyone could do with a cat carcass and waterlogged chalk.",
  "",
  "Then she retreated up the hill and watched for the bone army's coming.",
  "",
  "The wait was interminable.",
  "Alice was filled with bloodlust and chalk dust, with nowhere yet to put them.",
  "She was long past the point of fear.",
  "She felt she was on a speeding train, fast approaching the crash, and she hated to feel the minutes pass because it was all putting off the end.",
  "Several times she thought or hoped she heard clicking, but they were only memories become too vivid.",
  "Each time she shook her head, like a dog shaking off water, and the clicking ceased.",
  "",
  "At last she saw that roving line of white.",
  "No Kripkes in sight.",
  "Just a menagerie of reconstructed bones; dogs and cats and what looked like a small cavalry of raccoons.",
  "",
  "This was a much larger horde than had attacked her and Peter outside Greed.",
  "She wondered if the Kripkes knew she was something special, if they had assembled all their best forces specially for her.",
  "They drew closer, covering the distance with astonishing speed.",
  "She counted under her breath.",
  "Thirty white horses upon a red hill, she thought.",
  "First they champ.",
  "Then they stamp.",
  "The bone-things reached the base of the hill.",
  "And now they stand still.",
  "",
  "She squeezed tight the hilt of her knife.",
  "",
  "For a moment she was ready to fight the horde whole.",
  "She had forgotten that her spells did indeed work, and she was quite a good magician, until she saw the evidence.",
  "She had been right.",
  "The bone-things could not do calculus, and could not tell Zeno from God.",
  "A third of the horde slowed, and slowed again, and slowed down infinitely until their spindly little legs beat pointlessly into degrees of diminishing fractions.",
  "Only a lucky few skirted round the piles of their incapacitated friends, and when they got up the hill this number was whittled to a mere handful.",
  "",
  "The bravest among them approached her sniffing, cautious now.",
  "It had the slender, trembling build of a whippet.",
  "",
  "“Stop it,” she told it sternly.",
  "“Go.",
  "Sit.”",
  "",
  "The bone-thing yipped and sprang.",
  "",
  "Alice smashed her blade against its side.",
  "It fell, and before it could get up Alice slammed the knife down again and again until its ribs cracked open and its limbs splayed at its sides.",
  "",
  "Alice rose.",
  "“Anyone else?”",
  "",
  "They all sprang at once.",
  "",
  "But they were so slow! Alice could not believe how easy this was.",
  "Snorting chalk had done something to her vision, had altered her perception of time and space.",
  "Her sight broadened and sharpened both at once.",
  "She could see every little bit of them, all the chalk that animated their joints, every stroke of the Kripkes' meticulous handwriting.",
  "And she knew precisely where to hit them, so that the rest would fall apart.",
  "She knew when they would spring, where they were aiming, and where they would be.",
  "She knew to get there first.",
  "",
  "Thwack.",
  "Thwack.",
  "She wielded a blade in her right arm and a flask in her left, sprinkling the air like a priest sprinkles holy water.",
  "The water dissolved their joints, and her knife did the rest, and a pile of bones began building up around her ankles as she danced.",
  "",
  "God, what couldn't she do? It was exactly that manic feeling she got when she'd drunk five cups of coffee and felt suddenly confident that she could master any field if she put her mind to it—that very brief high always followed by a dreadful crash.",
  "Only here the crash never came, and with each movement, as Alice's blood pumped hotter, the world grew slower and slower until she had the frightening sensation that her mind might race right out of her body.",
  "But sanity held, and her mind and body did not come apart.",
  "She hung there at the brink of transcendence, when all the world stood still and its fault lines pulsed visible.",
  "She had a flashback to those late nights in the lab, every time she'd blinked and seen the hidden world—and now it was all laid out in front of her, not in abstract, but in terrible concreteness.",
  "Just bones to shatter.",
  "Spines to break.",
  "",
  "If only Elspeth could have seen her! She recalled Elspeth dancing with her spear along the shore, and imagined her own movements now were just as graceful.",
  "This was fun! She didn't only defend herself from their hacking jaws, she made an art of it.",
  "She swung her blade in the prettiest, most elegant arcs.",
  "The philosopher Zhuangzi once met a butcher who was so practiced in his arts that his blade never dulled; he slid his cleaver through the hollow spaces, where he met no resistance.",
  "This is the Way, thought Alice; I see those hollow spaces.",
  "She sliced so cleanly through their spines she carved them apart in one blow.",
  "One poor runt she bounced off the hilt of her knife and decapitated in midair as it fell.",
  "This must have been how lumberjacks felt.",
  "Every time they swung an axe and wood cleaved in two.",
  "What a pleasure, this tactile competence.",
  "Clean destruction—and the earth cracks beneath your hands.",
  "",
  "When she'd dispensed with her attackers she descended the hill and dispensed with the trapped things, too.",
  "She felt it prudent to be thorough.",
  "The Kripkes might free them, and then she'd be in trouble.",
  "But the Kripkes were as yet hidden, and her targets frozen in place, and their spines gave so easily when she chopped them clean through.",
  "",
    "She thought she read fear in their bones.",
  "Yes, they actually trembled.",
  "They could not move their legs, but they could quiver, duck their heads, shrink back in every imitation of living things fearing the whip.",
  "And this might have stilled her, but then she saw layered over their heads Peter's wan face, and the knives grinding in midair.",
  "She swung.",
  "When the blade met their spines, the cracks sounded so pleasing that her delight drowned out everything else.",
  "She had never before felt the high of sheer entropy.",
  "Indeed it felt so good to just make things fall apart.",
  "She wanted it to go on forever—was disappointed, indeed, when she realized her targets had run out; there was nothing more to attack.",
  "",
  "Alice stood, chest heaving, and stared over the empty dunes.",
  "At her feet, a disembodied skull nipped at her ankle.",
  "She gave it a savage kick.",
  "It rolled, tumbling down the hill, then came to a stop amidst the carnage.",
  "",
  "She'd demolished the horde.",
  "The fields were silent.",
  "",
  "“Come on,” she panted.",
  "Chalk burned her nostrils.",
  "She had a wild vision of eating the Kripkes alive; of plucking their heads off their necks and chewing through them whole.",
  "“Come on out.”",
  "",
  "They appeared seconds later—three figures bounding on the hill, their eyes black, and their bodies encased in armor made of bone.",
  "Papa and Mama and Baby Bear, come back from our vacation.",
  "Goldilocks has been very bad in our house.",
  "Goldilocks must be stuck like a pig.",
  "Pouches hung at their waists—wet, full-to-bursting pouches that jiggled when they moved—and their arms glistened with fresh, red blood.",
  "Peter's blood.",
  "",
  "The Kripkes paused a moment to take in the carnage.",
  "They conferred among themselves.",
  "Alice wished she could hear what they said, because they probably involved some compliments.",
  "Skilled magician.",
  "Oh, yes, very skilled.",
  "Probably trained at Oxbridge.",
  "We must be careful.",
  "",
  "Then the Kripkes swept through the field.",
  "Alice should have known her silly spells would hardly dissuade them.",
  "And yet, the speed of their demolition dismayed her.",
  "Nick Kripke seemed not even to read what she'd written.",
  "One look at the exposed chalk, and that was enough.",
  "Blood arced freely from his pouch, and he tossed counter-spells onto the sand, dismantling her proofs without looking.",
  "He never broke his stride; even the White Horse Paradox hardly fazed him, and here Alice was certain that Nick had never studied Chinese.",
  "Theophrastus and Magnolia followed in his footsteps as one by one Alice's defenses melted away.",
  "",
  "Theophrastus paused briefly at the two-step Liar Paradox—his feet rocked back and forth as he sounded out the words—but then Magnolia tugged him aside and kicked the red sand away.",
  "",
  "They looked up.",
  "They saw her now, standing atop her hill.",
  "",
  "She saw them clearly too; their rangy, lean forms, their spiked and shining armor.",
  "The top halves of their faces were hidden under helmets made of bone, and the eyes she saw through the dead creatures' sockets gleamed with sinister intelligence.",
  "They wore identical leers; thin lips stretched back to reveal sharpened, black-rimmed teeth.",
  "Magnolia's lips looked so vibrantly red, the scarlet shine of department store lipstick.",
  "Though Alice could not imagine where in Hell she found such bright pigment, except in blood.",
  "",
  "Primitive was not the word.",
  "They had not devolved, like a family lost for months on a hike; they had not lost their faculties in despair.",
  "Neither did they resemble Elspeth, whose piecemeal attire was junk scraps made pathetic, homespun art.",
  "The Kripkes' armor was flawless, tailored to indecipherable purpose.",
  "They are aliens now, thought Alice.",
  "They did not move like humans; they did not think like humans.",
  "They had evolved and adapted to their terrain, become the apex predators the underworld lacked.",
  "",
  "Every inch of her body wanted to flee.",
  "She had to shout down her instincts with her tinny rational mind.",
  "Run, and Gradus will mock you.",
  "Run, and you prolong what must come.",
  "Run, and your back is to the beast.",
  "",
  "The Kripkes stopped at the base of the hill.",
  "They watched her for the longest moment, all three heads tilted left to identical degrees.",
  "Nick and Magnolia conferred.",
  "Then Magnolia trudged up first, Theophrastus in her wake.",
  "",
  "Alice's mind went unbidden to the acknowledgments of so many monographs.",
  "Last of all, many thanks to my loving wife, who kept our house, set our tables, fed our children, typed up all my notes, and came up with most of my original ideas as well.",
  "My dear, you make our lives possible; your love inspires me.",
  "",
  "“Who are you,” Alice scoffed.",
  "“The research assistants?”",
  "",
  "Theophrastus broke away and ran screeching up the hill.",
  "This seemed even to startle Magnolia, for she reached out to try to grab him.",
  "He evaded her grasp, scrambling on all fours at an inhuman pace up the sands, growling and yipping as if he were a wolf.",
  "",
  "Alice saw a dizzying montage of all the misbehaved children she had ever encountered.",
  "Toddlers throwing fits at the grocery shop.",
  "Cousins over for the holidays, screaming their cheeks scarlet.",
  "Helen Murray's squalling brood, whom she had once babysat for pocket change.",
  "The younger boy had pooped his pants and pretended he hadn't.",
  "The older sisters had screeched with laughter and danced around singing that he stank, and the youngest one decided she was a lion and kept sinking her teeth into Alice's ankles.",
  "Alice remembered how children could be capable of such gleeful destruction; how they smashed and hit things with no care for the consequences; how at Helen Murray's house, she'd had a guilty, violent impulse to smack one of them across the face.",

  "Pasir Neraka masih samar-samar terlihat, tetapi berlapis di atasnya adalah dinding merah marun dan papan tulis yang familier dari Laboratorium Ruang Sembilan.",
  "Lantai berdebu kapur, jamur yang persisten.",
  "Di lantai, diatur rapi di dalam pentagram kembar, terbaring tubuh palsu yang telah disiapkan Alice dengan sangat hati-hati.",
  "Semua potongan kotor itu, dijahit seperti monster Frankenstein; cukup otot dan tulang serta ligamen untuk menyusun wajah, semua biomekanik yang diperlukan untuk menciptakan kembali suara.",
  "",
  "Dia heran tidak ada yang membersihkannya setelah sekian lama.",
  "Dia takut mereka mungkin terhubung ke kehampaan, bahwa ketika dia menyelesaikan mantranya mereka akan terjepit di suatu tempat yang tak terhindarkan di antara dunia.",
  "Tapi dia sangat berhati-hati.",
  "Dia memilih ruang bawah tanah yang tidak pernah digunakan siapa pun, mengunci pintunya rapat-rapat, dan memesannya atas nama orang lain, seorang postdoc yang bolak-balik dari London dan jarang berada di kampus.",
  "Dan dia bahkan telah menuliskan beberapa mantra yang memperlambat pembusukan, sehingga meskipun mayat itu berbau busuk, mayat itu masih belum membusuk.",

  "",
  "Catatan Erichtho telah memperingatkan hal ini.",
  "Jiwa dicabut dari dunia bawah dan dipaksa masuk secara kasar ke dalam tubuh mati atau sekarat yang bukan miliknya.",
  "Semuanya salah—setiap otot, setiap tulang dan ligamen—semuanya terlalu besar atau terlalu kecil dan begitu, begitu asing, dan dia sangat menderita, setiap saraf di tubuhnya menjerit, terbakar.",
  "",
  "Sangat sulit membaca nada dalam bahasa Yunani Kuno, tetapi Alice pikir penyihir itu pasti merasakan kepuasan jahat saat menulis ini.",
  "Alice juga terkekeh saat membaca halaman-halaman itu.",
  "Aku akan memberimu tubuh, Profesor, aku akan membawamu kembali.",
  "Kita lihat bagaimana kau menyukainya.",
  "",
  "Tetapi betapa mengerikannya menyaksikan mantra itu beraksi; melihat kehancuran mulut itu berputar terbuka dan mengeluarkan suara terburuk yang pernah didengarnya.",
  "",
  "Sihir adalah kesalahan, pikir Alice.",
  "Ini adalah ikatan yang tidak wajar, batas ini seharusnya tidak pernah dilanggar.",
  "Dia merasakan empedu, pusaran rasa bersalah—apa yang telah dilakukannya, dia harus mengakhiri penderitaannya—tetapi kemudian Nick melolong lebih keras, dan dinding laboratorium tampak bergetar dan runtuh.",
  "Seluruh ruangan berkedip, seperti dunia mimpi yang larut saat bangun, tetapi tidak memudar.",
  "Dunia-dunia itu saling merembes.",
  "Karpet berubah menjadi pasir abu-abu; gurun berubah menjadi dinding, semuanya terjalin dalam kekacauan tanpa harapan yang membingungkan.",
  "",
  "Tapi Alice sudah terbiasa dengan ini.",
  "Dia telah bertahan begitu lama melihat banyak dunia berlapis satu sama lain.",
  "Gambar-gambar yang berkedip masuk dan keluar tidak membuatnya bingung; dia tahu cara bergerak di dalamnya.",
  "Jadi sementara Nicomachus Kripke tersedak oleh kengerian kehidupan, Alice menariknya dengan tekad menuju tepi tebing.",
  "Mereka sudah sangat dekat sekarang, hanya beberapa kaki jauhnya.",
  "Yang dibutuhkan sekarang hanyalah dorongan.",
  "Sungai akan melakukan sisanya.",

  "Kekuatan kehendak Nick Kripke luar biasa.",
  "Alice melihatnya berusaha berkonsentrasi, membebaskan jiwanya.",
  "Tidak ada yang bisa dia lakukan.",
  "Mantranya hanya membangun hubungan; dia tidak punya kekuatan untuk menjebaknya di kedua sisi.",

  "Anugerah ilahi menyelamatkannya saat itu.",

  "The fall was not far, but the water was shallow and the rocks so hard.",
  "For a moment Alice could not see for the pain.",
  "All her limbs exploded white, an electric field that only gradually dimmed to throbbing red bursts.",
  "She lifted her head, then her arms.",
  "Her legs would not move.",
  "All she could manage was a dazed half-sit so she did not lie submerged while she processed which pieces were still attached to her body.",
  "She blinked at the sky.",
  "A pale circle hung straight above her, barely visible.",
  "It was less a defined shape than a ripple in the sky.",
  "If one looked askance, it disappeared back into the orange.",
  "Oh, she thought. The moon.",
  "So that's where she's been.",
  "",
  "Several feet away Nick Kripke hauled himself upright.",
  "Water came up to his ankles.",
  "He glanced down at his feet, head cocked, as if he could not comprehend where he stood.",
  "He blinked, then raised his head slightly, staring ahead at nothing.",
  "He seemed like an old man who'd come down to the kitchen for a glass of water and forgotten what he was doing.",
  "",
  "He looked to Alice.",
  "\"Excuse me,\" he rasped, and Alice was stunned to hear a voice wholly human from that armored throat. \"I seem . . . I seem to have left . . .\"",
  "Then that gleaming intelligence came back to his eyes, and Nick Kripke realized where he was.",
  "With a shout he lifted one foot out of the water, then the other, then jumped pointlessly on alternating feet as simple physics caught up to him.",
  "Alas, he could not levitate.",
  "Alice watched, fascinated, as Nick danced a desperate jig toward the shore while memories streamed out of him, fast and urgent, a vast and building current.",
  "They flowed past her with frightening speed.",
  "A film sped up eight times, sixteen, thirty-two; too fast to make out anything distinct except the most glancing impressions.",
  "A campus in the dark, white chalk on a board.",
  "The current grew larger and Nick grew smaller.",
  "A Popsicle in a boiling pot, thought Alice.",
  "When he reaches the edge, how much will be left?",
  "He'd nearly made it, he was only several steps from shore.",
  "But the memories seemed to have an attractive force of their own.",
  "The current was too great; the memories lost clung to the memories remaining.",
  "The current swelled.",
  "Nick Kripke tipped forward, fingers clawing for the bank.",
  "Alice saw on his face a look of utter terror.",
  "He met her eyes, and his right hand twitched—begging? Supplication?",
  "By instinct she moved to help him.",
  "But her limbs hurt so; pain exploded when she tried to stand up.",
  "She could only stare back at Nick, mute.",
  "For what was there to say?",
  "At that moment her mind went to the Lewis Carroll story.",
  "\"Balbus's Essay.\"",
  "Such a funny tale.",
  "An item submerged in liquid will displace liquid equivalent to its mass, but when the liquid is displaced, the water level must rise, but if the water level rises, the item is submerged further, and so the water must rise further, and on and on, until a man at the edge of the sea, who even just dips in his toes, must soon be drowned.",

  "A pair of professors at Yale were married—she a classicist, he a logician—and they were constantly unhappy, their students and advisees caught in the crossfire of their disputes.",
  "The trouble was that she'd left a tenure-track position at Stanford to join him at Yale as his spousal hire, meaning that her tenure was dependent on his; he was a full professor, and she would only ever be a lecturer.",
  "He had edited three volumes; she had only published a handful of papers, and rumors proliferated that she'd asked him many times to help her further her career but he had refused on the grounds of nepotism.",

  "",
  "And when Magnolia left the stage, she didn't seem to step out of her role; didn't transition from star to wife and mother.",

                  "When Alice came to, they were sitting at the prow of the Neurath, the shore a faint line behind them.",
  "Archimedes sat contently in Elspeth's lap.",
  "His forelegs were neatly wrapped up, bandages tied with precise little bows.",
  "She stroked the back of her index finger along his spine and he arched, purring, into her touch.",
  "",
  "Alice straightened up.",
  "“Elspeth?”",
  "“Yes.”",
  "“How old is that cat?”",
  "",
  "Elspeth blinked and cocked her head, as if the thought had only now crossed her mind.",
  "She tapped a finger against Archimedes's nose, and Archimedes sneezed.",
  "“Are you still letting him drink out of that same water bowl?”",
  "",
  "“What water bowl?” Alice thought hard.",
  "“That thing in the garden?”",
  "",
  "“My God.” Elspeth was laughing.",
  "“We turned it into a Perpetual Flask, so we wouldn't have to keep filling it.",
  "It's still there?”",
  "",
  "Archimedes rubbed his cheek against Elspeth's elbow, drawing her hand back to his spine.",
  "Then he stretched himself out across Elspeth's legs, nearly doubling in length, and stayed that way.",
  "He looked very pleased with himself.",
  "",
  "“Look at you.” Elspeth leaned in toward Alice.",
  "“You've learned to dress just like them.”",
  "",
  "Alice glanced down and ran her fingers over the cat's rib cage, embarrassed.",
  "“I thought some armor would be nice.”",
  "",
  "“Where did you get it?” Elspeth took in Alice's wan face, the dried blood across her cheeks and arms, then shook her head.",
  "“Never mind.",
  "I can imagine.”",
  "",
  "“It saved my life,” murmured Alice.",
  "She felt she had to give credit to the cat.",
  "“It stilled their blades.”",
  "",
  "“They're gone, then?” Elspeth asked urgently.",
  "“You saw them dissolve?”",
  "",
  "“All three, one by one.” Alice thought of Theophrastus, still and obedient in Magnolia's arms.",
  "“It's finished.”",
  "",
  "“But why didn't the water affect you?”",
  "",
  "Alice rolled up her sleeve.",
  "Her arm had turned a red and mottled mess, the site of a still-active chemical reaction.",
  "The white lines were blurred, bubbling and frothing at their edges where oblivion battled against permanence.",
  "Even Professor Grimes's magick could not withstand the Lethe—the lines were fading, the water was winning.",
  "",
  "Elspeth traced her finger over Alice's arm, lips moving silently as she read.",
  "“Grimes did this to you?”",
  "",
  "This time Alice did not contest the transitive.",
  "“Mm.”",
  "",
  "“You let him?”",
  "",
  "“He said it would make me a better magician.”",
  "",
  "“Did it?”",
  "",
  "“I'm sure he thought it would,” said Alice, because it seemed like the only honest answer.",
  "“I'm sure he hoped it would.”",
  "",
  "She braced herself as she said this, but Elspeth only nodded.",
  "There was no anger on her face.",
  "She held on to Alice's arm, cool fingers stroking against the wet skin.",
  "They were both silent, watching as the colors swirled on Alice's arm, as white chalk and black water mixed and fought, until the white lines shimmered pale, and at last faded away.",
  "",
  "“So are you . . .” Elspeth pointed to Alice's temples.",
  "“You're all right in the head, still?",
  "You know where you are?”",
  "",
  "“I think so, yes.”",
  "",
  "“You've still got it all?”",
  "",
  "Alice prodded her memory.",
  "She knew enough that she was not confused about where she was or how she had gotten here, but beyond that, she really couldn't say.",
  "There were patches that she had, and patches she knew were gone, and even more patches whose loss she didn't know to register at all.",
  "For a moment she found this prospect terrifying—that memory was not a well-kept library, but rather a moth-eaten basement with dim, flickering lights—but remembered then that this was just how everyone lived all the time; how she herself had lived most of her life.",
  "You groped around in the dark.",
  "You settled for stories, not recordings.",
  "You made do with the bits you had and tried your best to fill in the rest.",
  "",
  "“Not all,” she said.",
  "“But I've got enough.”",
  "",
  "Elspeth cooked for her that night.",
  "She seemed very excited about the occasion; she spent nearly an hour clamoring around the little stove, digging up spice bottles and making exclamations like “The rats were fat this week, just crackling on the stove.”",
  "After an hour of effort she served up a stew of salt, congealed blood, and some thick, stringy meat that hurt Alice's mouth to chew.",
  "Alice wolfed it all down, swallowing stew in hot, satisfying gulps, then gnawed at the bones until her gums bled.",
  "",
  "“Taste good?” asked Elspeth.",
  "",
  "“Incredible,” Alice gasped.",
  "",
  "Elspeth waited, beaming, as Alice drained the bowl and licked at its insides.",
  "Then she scooted closer so that they sat face-to-face, inches away.",
  "“I feel an apology is in order.”",
  "",
  "Alice put down her bowl.",
  "“I'm so sorry—”",
  "",
  "“I feel rotten about what happened,” said Elspeth.",
  "“I shouldn't have left you two on that shore.”",
  "",
  "“We betrayed you.” Stew trickled down the side of Alice's mouth.",
  "She wiped her chin against her shoulder.",
  "“I'd be angry, too.”",
  "",
  "“I just couldn't understand it,” said Elspeth.",
  "“Why you'd ever want to go back to him.”",

  "“Right.”",
  "",
  "“He is simply monstrous.” Elspeth's hand moved up and down in a staccato, as if she were lecturing to an undergraduate.",
  "Basic principles.",
  "“You must know this.",
  "He leeches the life from you.",
  "So when you said the name Grimes—I don't know, something just came over me, and then I couldn't think straight—”",
  "",
  "“Please don't apologize,” said Alice.",
  "“It's my fault.",
  "You took us in, you sheltered us, and we . . .” She swallowed.",
  "“I can't justify it.",
  "We knew what we wanted and how to get it and everything else was—I don't know, just collateral.",
  "I wasn't thinking about you at all.",
  "All I could think was, What would he do?",
  "How I could make him proud.”",
  "",
  "“Well.” Elspeth sniffed.",
  "“He has that effect.”",
  "",
  "They sat a moment in silence.",
  "Once again they regarded one another, two bruised girls with too much in common.",
  "But this time there was no measuring up, no guesswork, only a tired recognition.",
  "I know how you got here.",
  "I know what it took.",
  "",
  "“It's all so stupid.” Alice rubbed her palm against her temple.",
  "“I just can't figure out why—I mean, he has everything, you know?",
  "And I don't know what he needs, or if he's hurting—”",
  "",
  "“Stop trying to justify him.”",
  "",
  "“I wasn't—”",
  "",
  "“You were.",
  "Listen, Alice, I've been there.",
  "I've spent years trying to justify him.",
  "Everything you just said, I've been down that road.",
  "I've considered it all.",
  "So please trust me when I tell you there's nothing more to it.",
  "Some people just are that cruel.",
  "There is no design.",
  "They are not giants.",

  "",
  "“I know that,” Alice said tiredly.",
  "“I only mean—”",
  "",
  "“We weren't special for it.",
  "We weren't—worthy of it, or handpicked for it, or anything like that, can't you understand?” Elspeth's hand moved again in that lecturing staccato.",
  "Harsher this time.",
  "“He did not care.",
  "It was completely random.",
  "We were just there.”",
  "",
  "“But can't you see,” said Alice, “why I'd choose to believe anything different?”",
  "",
  "“Oh, love.” Elspeth placed her hand over Alice's.",
  "“You don't have to believe anything about him at all.”",
  "",
  "Alice supposed this was reasonable.",
  "The stakes of this debate were suddenly opaque to her.",
  "Whether Grimes had ever cared, whether she deserved it all—suddenly she couldn't see why these propositions ever mattered to her in the first place.",
  "The name Jacob Grimes hung empty in her mind, a symbol with no referent.",
  "No flood of memory attended the call.",
  "The whole issue seemed shorn of significance, as if she had spent so much time working through its implications that the threads had snapped altogether, and now it was just crumpled paper.",
  "It simply did not matter.",
  "",
  "“Thanks,” she said.",
  "Suddenly it felt very difficult to put words together.",
  "Her lids felt very heavy.",
  "“I think—I think that's right.”",
  "",
  "“Forgive me.",
  "You're exhausted.” Elspeth rummaged beneath the seat and dug out a thick, ratty blanket that might have once adorned some grandmother's couch.",
  "“Go on, you're safe.",
  "I'll be right here.”",
  "",
  "Alice took the blanket and draped it around her shoulders.",
  "It smelled rank, somehow of mothballs and mildew both, but still this was the most comforting thing she had smelled in ages.",
  "She wrapped it snug and held the edges close to her face.",
  "It reminded her of guest rooms and grandparents.",
  "She couldn't get enough of it.",
  "",
  "Elspeth watched her settle back against the boards.",
  "Then she asked, very lightly, “By the way, where's Peter?”",
  "",
  "Alice hesitated, wondering how best to explain.",
  "Then she burst into tears.",
  "",
  "“Oh, dear.” Elspeth fished around in her pocket and handed her a handkerchief, oily and stained.",
  "Alice took it and mopped it around her eyes.",
  "She was horrified; the tears simply would not stop.",
  "She hadn't meant to cry.",
  "She hadn't even planned to feel sad.",
  "But just then it was like a switch flipped and that veneer of dazed indifference shattered, and all the grief she'd been carrying broke through the floodgates.",
  "",
  "“My apologies,” said Elspeth.",
  "",
  "“It's fine.”",
  "",
  "“What happened?”",
  "",
  "Alice wanted to answer but felt an overwhelming fatigue the moment she tried to open her mouth.",
  "She did not want to recount it.",
  "She could not put it into words.",
  "She felt fragile to the point of breaking, and to rearticulate those last moments in the trap might shatter her.",
  "All she could do was shake her head.",
  "",
  "“I see,” said Elspeth.",
  "",
  "There was nothing to do but let the weeping run its course, to succumb to the racks and shudders until the flood subsided, and all the phlegm and snot was run out, and finally Alice could take a breath without howling.",
  "",
  "“He decided it should be me.” Her fingers curled into balls.",
  "“He didn't even ask—he just decided—and then I was out, and he was gone.”",
  "",
  "“Of course he did.”",
  "",
  "“What does that mean?”",
  "",
  "“But surely you knew.” Elspeth gave her a look of deep pity.",
  "“He was in love with you.”",
  "",
  "Two contradictory statements came to Alice's mind then, and she couldn't decide which one seemed more plausible, so she uttered them both.",
  "“That can't be.” And then, “But I didn't know.”",
  "",
  "“Then you're blind,” said Elspeth, “because it was written all over his face.",
  "Yours, too.”",
  "",
  "Alice reasoned that Elspeth was probably right.",
  "If she thought about it, a small part of her suspected the same.",
  "Only she didn't know what to do with this information.",
  "She wished she could carve it out of her chest; set it flaming and quivering down somewhere else, maybe lock it in a box, if it would just leave her alone.",
  "",
  "“But we were fighting when we met you,” said Alice.",
  "“He hated me.”",
  "",
  "“All the same.",
  "If anything, that made it easier to tell.”",
  "",
  "“But he never said.” Alice sniffled, pulling the blanket tighter around her shoulders.",
  "“I wish he'd just said.”",
  "",
  "Elspeth shook her head, smiling sadly.",
  "",
  "“Magicians,” she sighed.",
  "“Fools, all of us.”",
  "",
  "Alice slept.",
  "What delicious sleep it was; quick and dreamless, sleep that came easy and made time slip away.",
  "Elspeth was staring at her when she awoke, her face tight and pensive.",
  "She kept tapping her fingers against her leg.",
  "Her mouth twitched, like it couldn't decide between a smile and a frown.",
  "",
  "Alice sat up.",
  "“What is it?”",
  "",
  "“I am trying to decide whether to help you.”",
  "",
  "“Oh.",
  "Well let me know if I can offer any input.”",
  "",
  "Elspeth did not respond.",
  "",
  "Alice set her hands on her lap and watched the water rippling.",
  "She felt like a naughty child in time-out.",
  "She felt she was being weighed, though she couldn't say what for.",
  "",
  "At last Elspeth sighed.",
  "“I haven't been fully honest with you.”",
  "",
  "“That's more than fair.”",
  "",
  "“No, look.” She drew a satchel out from beneath the paddles.",
  "She placed her hand inside, hesitated for a moment, then withdrew an item.",
  "She placed it in Alice's hands.",
  "“Here.”",
  "",
  "Alice understood immediately what she beheld.",
  "",
  "A Dialetheia.",
  "She peeled the fabric back and found the most curious plant she had ever seen: a Janus-headed flower, one face with seven petals the red-orange hue of the rising sun, twinned at the back by a second face with seven petals of identical shape, these the bluish-white of a falling moon.",
  "Vibrant and deathly both at once; warm and cool.",
  "A pomegranate tree growing defiantly in the land of the dead.",
  "A True Contradiction, the thing that could not be.",
  "",
  "“I found it just before we met,” said Elspeth.",
  "“The Kripkes weren't after you.",
  "I should have told you.",
  "They were hot on my heels.",
  "They were after me.”",
  "",
  "Alice turned the True Contradiction over in her hands, marveling at the brilliant hues along the stems and stamens, at the delicate, tiny buds emerging from the tips of the branches.",
  "What a relief, to see such colors after weeks in grays and black.",
  "The only splash that had broken up the monotony was the brilliant red of blood—but here, finally, was green.",
  "",
  "“Where was it?”",
  "",
  "“In a crack between two boulders at the bank of the Lethe.",
  "Can you imagine?",
  "No fanfare, no fairy rings.",
  "Just growing there, impossibly, with nothing to announce itself.",
  "I would have passed by it entirely if I weren't looking for a place to moor.”",
  "",
  "Alice heard Peter's voice in her head.",
  "The world is not a complete system; there is always an exception.",
  "No explanation for its existence; no reason why one might expect it to have existed before or ever exist again.",
  "The world was simply unknowable; exceptions cropped up all the time, and all you had to do to beat the odds was just look.",
  "",
  "“Hold it close,” said Elspeth.",
  "“Drop that and I'll kill you.”",
  "",
  "“My word.” Alice held it closer, marveling.",
  "The petals were so fine, thinner than paper, their translucence lined with patterns like lace.",
  "“A contradiction explosion . . .” Slowly the implications caught up to her.",
  "They wouldn't just be able to leave Hell.",
  "They could change everything.",
  "With the True Contradiction on one side of a proof, they could write anything else into validity.",
  "They could end world hunger, end famine and wars, reshape reality's boundaries however they liked.",
  "If they could just get the True Contradiction out of this place, they could do anything.",
  "“But then that makes you God, Elspeth.",
  "You could do anything you liked.",
  "Reality's just putty in your hands . . .”",
  "",
  "“You still need blood,” said Elspeth.",
  "“Where do you think I'd get all that blood?”",
  "",
  "“But still . . .”",
  "",
  "“And the archives are quite clear on the limits,” said Elspeth.",
  "“The Dialetheia won't work above.",
  "It's only a miracle in Hell.",
  "Above, it's just a tree.”",
  "",
  "Elspeth leaned back, arms folded.",
  "“It seems to me that the only useful way to employ a True Contradiction is to take it back to the Lord of Hell.",
  "That's how Orpheus bargained for Eurydice.",
  "The Lady Persephone was so moved by his music that she gifted him the first Dialetheia as a favor, and then Hades had to barter with him to retrieve it.",
  "The Dialetheia has too much power to let loose in the world, you see.",
  "It's no use to us down here, but the Lord of Death needs it back.",
  "So you take it to the final court, to the throne on the island at the edge of the world, and you offer it up freely.",
  "You always get one boon, that's what the stories say.",
  "And with that boon, you ask for your life.” Elspeth nodded to the Dialetheia.",
  "“So be careful what you say up there.",
  "You only get the one chance.”",
  "",
  "It took Alice a long moment to realize she had just been given instructions.",
  "",
  "She could not find the words.",
  "She had no frame of reference to make sense of this, this impossible generosity.",
  "It defied every rule she'd been taught about moving within the world, in which favors were like the conservation of matter.",
  "A give always entailed a take.",
  "“You're just giving it to me?”",
  "",
  "“Well, don't look so put out about it.”",
  "",
  "“But can you find another one?”",
  "",
  "“It's a Dialetheia, you fool.",
  "They don't just grow on trees.”",
  "",
  "Alice did not know what to do with this gift.",
  "She could think of no appropriate response.",
  "Just then the Dialetheia felt so heavy in her grasp; she was seized with the irrational fear she might fling it into the water.",
  "",
  "Archimedes mewed in agitation.",
  "Elspeth scratched the back of his neck.",
  "“Hush, you,” she murmured.",
  "“I know what I'm doing.”",
  "",
  "A small part of Alice lit up with suspicion.",
  "Surely Elspeth wanted something.",
  "Everyone always wanted something.",
  "No magician ever did things out of kindness, or they wouldn't have gotten where they were.",
  "",
  "But there was no guile on Elspeth's face.",
  "Just a sweet, open sympathy.",
  "Just kindness.",
  "",
  "“But I don't deserve this.” She deserved none of the favors she had received.",
  "Peter's sacrifice, Gradus's sacrifice, now Elspeth.",
  "What am I to you, she wondered, that you would do this for me?",
  "Her mind cycled through the possible tropes: relations of dependence or charity; mother to child; elder sister to younger; mentor to mentee; lover to beloved.",
  "But none of them fit, none of them came close to approximating this singular, inexplicable grace.",

  "“Elspeth, why—”",
  "",

  "“We don't understand the gods very well,” said Elspeth.",
  "“But we should not assume they have the same constraints as mortal beings.",
  "King Yama theoretically has control over his entire domain.",

  "Lower Hell shone dimly on the horizon, the fires of Dis growing fainter and fainter until it blinked out into darkness.",
  "Then they had only the low flickering light of Elspeth's ember lamps, catching stray memories in the water.",

  "“Jadi kau akan mencari yang lain.”",
  "",
  "“Eh.” Elspeth memberinya senyum kecil.",
  "“Mungkin.”",
  "",
  "Kesadaran muncul.",
  "“Kau tidak mencari lagi.”",
  "",
  "“Aku sudah menunda yang tak terhindarkan begitu lama.” Elspeth memiliki tatapan menerawang di matanya.",
  "“Dan aku tidak ingin menundanya lagi.",
  "Aku lelah dengan Neurath, mengerti?",
  "Aku lelah selalu terapung-apung di laut.",
  "Aku ingin seseorang menyeberangkanku.”",
  "",
  "“Aku sudah melihat mereka,” kata Alice.",
  "“Kapal itu, para malaikat.",
  "Mereka datang untuk Gradus, dan aku menyaksikan . . .”",
  "",
  "Elspeth mencondongkan tubuh ke depan, bersemangat.",
  "“Oh, ya?”",
  "",
  "“Dan itu indah.” Alice sangat senang dia tidak perlu berbohong.",
  "“Persis seperti yang dijanjikan semua cerita.",
  "Mereka membiarkanmu naik.",
  "Mereka membiarkanmu minum.",
  "Dan kemudian mereka membawamu melewati cakrawala, ke apa pun yang ada di baliknya.”",
  "",
  "Elspeth mengetukkan buku-buku jarinya ke kursi kayunya.",
  "“Kalau begitu mari kita berharap mereka akan datang untukku akhirnya.”",
  "",
  "“Kau jauh di depan semua orang di Dis,” kata Alice.",
  "“Kau akan baik-baik saja.”",
  "",
  "Elspeth mengangguk.",
  "Alice melihat bibirnya mengencang karena sesuatu—ketakutan, mungkin—tetapi bibir itu segera mengalah pada tekad khas Elspeth.",
  "“Ada kemungkinan kau bisa memberitahuku cara keluar dari sana dengan cepat?”",
  "",
  "“Kau pikir aku tahu?”",
  "",
  "Elspeth terkekeh.",
  "“Adil, itu.",
  "Ada saran, kalau begitu?”",
  "",
  "“Hindari benteng itu.” Alice bersandar, menggenggam Dialetheia erat-erat di dadanya.",
  "“Benteng itu buang-buang waktu.”",
  "",
  "Elspeth memandu Neurath maju ke perairan tak dikenal.",
  "Mereka berlayar tanpa oleng atau terguling, di atas perairan yang begitu halus seperti kaca sehingga Alice akan mengira mereka duduk diam di daratan kering kecuali arus ingatan yang cepat meluncur di bawah mereka.",
  "Neraka Bawah bersinar redup di cakrawala, api Dis tumbuh semakin redup sampai berkedip padam menjadi kegelapan.",
  "Kemudian mereka hanya memiliki cahaya redup berkedip dari lampu bara Elspeth, menangkap ingatan-ingatan liar di air.",
  "Akhirnya ingatan itu pun diam, semua lenyap menjadi hitam pekat, dan mereka hanyalah dua jiwa yang duduk dalam gelap, mata terpaku pada wujud pucat satu sama lain.",
  "",
  "“Aku tidak tahu apa yang terjadi selanjutnya.” Mata Elspeth besar, ketakutan di wajahnya yang pucat pasi.",
  "“Aku belum pernah sejauh ini dari pantai.”",
  "",
  "Alice baru sadar bahwa dia tidak melakukan apa-apa dengan kemudi.",
  "Galah itu tergeletak diam di geladak; layarnya turun.",
  "Neurath meluncur maju atas kehendaknya sendiri, atau atas kehendak sesuatu yang lebih besar.",
  "",
  "“Bagaimana kau tahu ke mana kau pergi?”",
  "",
  "“Kau tidak perlu tahu,” kata Elspeth.",
  "“Ke mana pun kau berlayar mengarah ke tempat yang sama.",
  "Seperti mangkuk meluap, seperti air tumpah dari sisinya.",
  "Kekuatan mendorongmu ke luar, ke ujung dunia, dan tidak ada yang bisa dilakukan selain mengikuti.”",
  "",
  "“Anus pizza,” gumam Alice.",
  "",
  "“Apa katamu?”",
  "",
  "Alice menggambar lingkaran di udara, meskipun dia tidak yakin seberapa banyak itu membantu.",
  "“Kami tidak setuju tentang peta Neraka kami.",
  "Peter dan aku.",
  "Aku suka peta linier.",
  "Dia suka benda pseudosfer aneh ini, sesuatu yang hanya berfungsi di ruang hiperbolik.",
  "Dia pikir kau bisa melacak menjauh dari sungai, mengakses puncak Neraka melalui pusatnya.",
  "Secara dua dimensi, itu tampak seperti anus pizza.",
  "Dan sekarang kau memberitahuku kita berada di anus pizza.”",
  "",
  "“Kalian berdua benar.” Elspeth tertawa.",
  "“Yah, Peter lebih benar.",
  "Kita memang berada di ruang hiperbolik, Cinta.",
  "Dibatasi oleh sungai di luar dan ketidakterbatasan di dalam.",
  "Ketika kau tepat di sebelah Lethe, itu memang terlihat linier.",
  "Tetapi begitu kau mulai berlayar melintas—yah, maka itu di luar kendalimu.”",
  "",
  "“Apa yang terjadi di akhir?”",
  "",
  "“Aku tidak tahu.” Elspeth berkata lagi, “Aku belum pernah sejauh ini dari pantai.”",
  "",
  "Mereka meluncur semakin cepat sekarang.",
  "Alice merasakan udara dingin di pipinya; bukan angin, melainkan kecepatan.",
  "Mereka tidak bisa kembali sekarang bahkan jika mereka mencoba; gaya tarik terlalu besar.",
  "Ada urgensi dalam gerakan mereka; seperti perahu di dekat air terjun, melaju kencang menuju tepi.",
  "Archimedes duduk diam di haluan, pupil menyempit menjadi titik jarum.",
  "",
  "“Di sana,” bisik Elspeth.",
  "",
  "Alice duduk tegak, mengintip ke atas haluan.",
  "",
  "Pikirannya tidak bisa memahami apa yang dilihatnya.",
  "Ada pulau itu.",
  "Tetapi ketika matanya tertuju pada dataran itu, dan mengikutinya ke luar, dia mencatat kelengkungan yang membuat perutnya mulas.",
  "Entah bagaimana, ketika dia mengikuti lekukan itu, naik dan naik dan berputar, dia mendapati pandangannya kembali ke Neurath, mengapung diam di petak sungai kecil mereka.",
  "Rasanya seperti menelusuri tangga Escher.",
  "Tidak ada di baliknya.",
  "",
  "Dia harus berpaling; putaran itu membuat kepalanya sakit.",
  "",
  "Namun ini sangat masuk akal.",
  "Lewis Carroll telah berteori tentang ini—bagaimana lagi kau mengkonseptualisasikan hidup dan mati, selaput peralihan, kecuali sebagai kesinambungan?—tetapi tidak ada yang memercayainya.",
  "Ambil selembar kertas, putar di tengah, dan hubungkan ujung-ujungnya.",
  "Sangat bagus.",
  "Sekarang kau punya cincin, objek tiga dimensi yang bisa kau pegang di tanganmu.",
  "Tetapi hanya punya satu sisi.",
  "Bagian dalam bersambung dengan bagian luar.",
  "Sekarang lakukan hal yang sama dengan sapu tangan empat sisi.",
  "Putar tepinya, sejajarkan, dan jahit semuanya sehingga bagian dalam bersambung dengan bagian luar.",
  "Semua eksternal terhadap tas, yang berarti semua juga internal terhadap tas, dan karena itu tas menampung dunia.",
  "",
  "Mustahil digambar, mustahil bahkan dibayangkan.",
  "Tetapi di sini Alice melihatnya langsung.",
  "",
  "“Bidang proyektif,” gumam Elspeth.",
  "“Mencengangkan.”",

  "Pasir hitam begitu dekat sekarang.",
  "Yang bisa dilihat Alice di pantai itu hanyalah sejalin cahaya keemasan tunggal, membentang dari tepian ke tempat tak dikenal di baliknya.",

  "Jari-jari Alice melingkar di sekitar Kontradiksi Sejati, dan dia menariknya erat ke dadanya.",
  "Sekarang saatnya mendekat, dia tiba-tiba takut.",
  "Dia merasakan penurunan yang sama di perutnya sebelum wawancara, ketika dia langsung lupa cara berjalan atau bernapas atau berbicara, dan takut bahwa ketika dia berjalan melewati pintu ruang konferensi dia mungkin akan meledak bernyanyi, atau membentur dinding.",
  "Dia telah berjuang keras untuk sampai di sini.",
  "Namun sekarang di akhir dia menyadari dia tidak tahu apa yang menantinya, dan tidak tahu apa yang harus dilakukan.",

  "Dia pikir dia melihat Elspeth melambaikan tangan sebagai perpisahan, tetapi dia tidak bisa memastikannya."

            original: [
                  "Alice followed the golden braid up the bank, the Dialetheia sitting heavy in her rucksack.",
  "Behind her the Lethe lapped gently against the shore, producing a soothing, rhythmic wash.",
  "The sands were so soft beneath her feet, and her heels sank a little every time she took a step.",
  "She had the oddest sensation that rather than walking across an island, she was walking through a cloud.",
  "",
  "She could give no reason for walking alongside the braid, except that it looked very much like a trail, and that she didn’t think anything so gold and bright could lead her somewhere bad.",
  "Of course bright and shiny things made up traps all the time, but in that case they winked and glittered with purpose, enticing you with every dash of glamour they could muster.",
  "The braid didn’t seem like it cared for her attention either way.",
  "Here it was minding its own business, but she could follow along if she liked.",
  "So follow she did.",
  "The braid took her up a shore, across the bank, and then up a steep hill growing steeper with every step.",
  "At last she reached the peak, and Alice saw that the braid had led her to a throne.",
  "",
  "It was an unadorned, high-backed chair, sitting out in the open upon a raised dais.",
  "Beside the throne, three slim trees intertwined to form an arch, beyond which Alice could see nothing more than a gently turning wheel.",
  "Atop the throne sat King Yama, Hades, Thanatos, the Lord of the Underworld, the Overseer of the Yellow Springs.",
  "",
  "Alice saw now that the golden braid was a chain of souls; mere lights bobbing one after the other, blurs stripped of all individual features, uniform in their quivering, vibrant want.",
  "One by one they approached the arch.",
  "One by one the Lord of Death touched them lightly with his dark fingers, and they seemed to quiver with excitement before casting forth into the wheel.",
  "The wheel shimmered each time a soul went past, and its spokes lifted them somewhere unknown, beyond.",
  "",
  "She tiptoed as she drew closer, for she felt, as one did at christenings or baptisms, that she ought not disturb the process.",
  "She was near enough now to see every spoke of the wheel.",
  "Each was different: some were long, some were short; some glimmered bright, some were dark with rust.",
  "A little waft of air floated across the throne as it turned; a bright sweet scent, of flowers in spring, herbs in a garden, and this was so refreshing that Alice could not help but gasp.",
  "",
  "“Alice Law,” rumbled the Lord of Hell.",
  "“It is a thrill to watch new life being made, is it not?”",
  "",
  "Alice struggled to gaze directly at him.",
  "He was brilliant; not with the harshness of the noon sun, but with the cosmic glittering of the night.",
  "He was, like the Weaver Girl, swathed in a fabric that seemed the same stuff that made the universe.",
  "Only his was infinitely darker; the color of a cloudless night when, lying flat on your back atop a hill, you might tip forward and disappear among the constellations.",
  "She could fall into that night, she thought.",
  "She could wrap his essence around her like a blanket and sleep forever, if only he would permit it.",
  "",
  "“My—my lord.”",
  "Her voice sounded so tinny to her ears.",
  "“I—erm, how should I address you?”",
  "",
  "“However you like,” said the darkness.",
  "“With whom do you wish to speak?”",
  "",
  "Alice considered her options.",
  "The darkness took a succession of shapes before her, as if making clear her choices.",
  "Tall, bearded Hades, bearing bident and key; dark mother Kali, four-armed and beautiful; silent Anubis, his scale standing behind him.",
  "",
  "“King Yama,” Alice decided.",
  "“Yanluo Wang.”",
  "",
  "Best to keep to the familiar.",
  "Despite his bulging eyes and rage-filled grin, something about his image—scowling out at her from temples, behind incense sticks, on grocery store calendars—made her feel safe.",
  "She knew King Yama; her parents knew King Yama; all her ancestors knew, and feared, and prayed to, King Yama.",
  "She knew his long black beard, his ever-present scowl, his burning eyes and long robe.",
  "She had known him all her life.",
  "",
  "King Yama was most fair and just.",
  "King Yama bore no grudges, and held no antipathy toward the living.",
  "Since her childhood she had understood that his scowl was only an appearance; that in truth King Yama was benevolent and compassionate, that he had indeed once been demoted to a lower rank of Hell for his leniency.",
  "He was dedicated only to fulfilling his duty, to acting as a judge—and his adherence to rules, she thought, could only count in her favor.",
  "",
  "The Lord of the Nine Springs blurred, and then the darkness took on shapes more material.",
  "Now before her stood the great official; his skin a deep blue, his eyes glowing like twin blood moons.",
  "A tall, gold-rimmed official’s cap materialized atop his head.",
  "His thick, black brows organized his face in a rictus of fury.",
  "A dreadful deity, yes; but a deity she knew.",
  "",
  "“Good choice.”",
  "He spoke to her in Chinese, and this too put her at ease.",
  "She felt she was not so much tempting the unknown as she was sinking into childhood myth.",
  "So many heroes had bartered with King Yama.",
  "She could too.",
  "“What can I do for you, Alice Law?”",
  "",
  "She tried to remember Elspeth’s script.",
  "“I seek an audience.”",
  "",
  "“You are enjoying one.",
  "What next?”",
  "",
  "King Yama’s eyes twinkled.",
  "Alice recalled then that according to some Buddhist texts, King Yama himself was not a permanent fixture of Hell, but a being who sought reincarnation himself.",
  "King Yama, like any of them, was on the path of his journey of transmigration.",
  "He had not ruled over this domain since the beginning of time, but indeed hoped to be reborn as a human, so that he might seek true awakening.",
  "And if King Yama had been human once, and might be human again, then perhaps he might have sympathy for her situation.",
  "He might know how it felt to make all the wrong decisions, and have no option but to beg the gods for mercy.",
  "",
  "“I have something that belongs to you.”",
  "Arms shaking, she reached into her rucksack and pulled out the Dialetheia.",
  "It shone even brighter now, in the shadow of the ever-turning wheel.",
  "It was heavier, too.",
  "Its leaves seemed to grow perceptibly by the minute; they were now the size of her palm.",
  "",
  "“Where did you find that?”",
  "",
  "“I didn’t,” said Alice.",
  "“It was a gift.",
  "From Elspeth Bayes.",
  "She found it—well, I don’t know, exactly.",
  "Between two rocks, she said.",
  "Close to the shore.”",
  "",
  "“Where is Elspeth now?” asked King Yama.",
  "",
  "“She’s moving through the courts now, I think.”",
  "Alice cleared her throat.",
  "“That is.",
  "The proper way.",
  "With her transcript.”",
  "",
  "“I am glad.",
  "I feared she never would.”",
  "King Yama swept his long-robed arms forth.",
  "“I’ll have that back now.”",
  "",
  "Alice clutched it to her chest.",
  "She didn’t mean to—it was a possessive instinct—and she felt immediately she had committed some great affront.",
  "Who was she to defy the gods?",
  "But at least Lord Yama did not seem angered.",
  "He only waited from his throne, wearing that constant scowl.",
  "",
  "“I—well, no.”",
  "She drew a shaky breath.",
  "“I was hoping we might—make a trade.",
  "I have some demands.”",
  "",
  "He nodded, as though he had been expecting this.",
  "“What are your demands?”",
  "",
  "“I want—” Alice halted.",
  "",
  "She thought she knew her answer.",
  "She had been so certain, sitting on the Neurath with the pomegranate tree beneath her legs.",
  "She had worked out the precise wording of her request; its constraints and logic.",
  "And yet here before the throne, at the end of all things, her mind went blank.",
  "",
  "Gently King Yama asked, “What was your purpose in Hell?”",
  "",
  "This question was easier.",
  "She answered like a child listing months of the year.",
  "“We came to find Professor Jacob Grimes.”",
  "",
  "“Merely to find him?” King Yama raised both hands.",
  "“You need not barter for that.”",
  "",
  "Darkness flew from his fingertips and moved in a spiral over the sand between them, swirling faster and faster until the circle took on a definite shape.",
  "It was something like a pentagram, but so much more potent.",
  "Pentagrams were meticulously crafted, written in languages known to man, while this circle was wrought of ragged symbols Alice had never seen.",
  "King Yama snapped his fingers.",
  "The ground jolted.",
  "A slumped figure appeared inside the black not-pentagram, hunched and indeterminate.",
  "The darkness stilled.",
  "The figure stood.",
  "",
  "“There,” said King Yama.",
  "“You’ve found him.”",
  "",
  "Professor Grimes was not one of the Shades who had put much effort into preserving their appearance.",
  "The only part of him rendered in any clear detail was his head; his hawklike features somehow emphasized, both bolder and more elegant than they’d been in life.",
  "Below the neck he was a flowing, formless darkness; the same shape of ghosts hung on Halloween.",
  "",
  "For a moment he turned in circles, taking in all that was around him.",
  "The Shade of Professor Grimes did not walk; he drifted and swooped like a bat.",
  "He observed the wheel, the golden braid, and the throne.",
  "His head tilted all the way back as he took in King Yama’s form.",
  "He chuckled.",
  "",
  "“So you are the architect of this realm? The mastermind of my suffering?” Professor Grimes stretched taller until he and Lord Yama were face-to-face.",
  "His feet did not touch the ground.",
  "His deathly form had no feet at all, only swirling gray.",
  "“Only a deity after all.",
  "It makes me wonder.",
  "What does it take to kill a god?”",
  "",
  "“I warn you, Jacob Grimes.” King Yama spoke now in English.",
  "His voice never rose above its calm rumble; not a hair in his beard ruffled out of place.",
  "And yet Alice felt the warning thick in the air; a thunderstorm about to break.",
  "“You are a guest in my realm.”",
  "",
  "“But what can you do?” On Professor Grimes’s lips, even the vilest insults took the form of mere inquiry.",
  "“You are bound by the laws of this place, as are we all.",
  "You are a guardian, a facilitator.",
  "Nothing more.”",
  "He gestured up to the sky.",
  "“No—the real big man is up top, isn’t he? Go on, tell me you’ve never tried to pierce his realm.”",
  "He turned to the wheel.",
  "“Fate, is that it? Suppose I choose a spoke for myself?”",
  "",
  "“You have not passed your trials,” rumbled Lord Yama.",
  "“You have no right to pass.",
  "You are here at the mercy of the girl only, and the wish I have granted.”",
  "",
  "“Of course.” Professor Grimes turned to Alice.",
  "His face split into a smile and, despite herself, Alice’s heart thrummed at the sight.",
  "“Dear Alice.",
  "I did wonder how long it would take you.",
  "But here you are, all in one piece—and the Dialetheia!”",
  "He reached for the little tree.",
  "Alice shrank back, but he only flew closer.",
  "There was no getting away from him.",
  "He buried his face in the petals, breathed deep, and sighed.",
  "“More glorious than I could ever have imagined.”",
  "He lifted his gaze to her eyes.",
  "“Alice Law.",
  "You brilliant thing.”",
  "",
  "Such praise.",
  "She could never forget how good his praise felt, like the whole sun turned upon her.",
  "She was reminded again that she mattered.",
  "She was like a desperately convoluted proof running down two sides of the paper, lines dwindling to cramped scribbles on the margins until, magically, it came out valid.",
  "Her heart hammered very fast in her chest, and a hot heady wash passed through her mind before she could sort her thoughts out and speak.",
  "",
  "“I don’t—but you—what do you mean, how long?”",
  "",
  "“I have been watching,” said Professor Grimes.",
  "“Clever girl.",
  "Following all the bread crumbs.",
  "But who do you think left them there?”",
  "",
  "Alice felt rather like a broken toy, capable only of repetition.",
  "“Bread crumbs?”",
  "",
  "“There’s quite a lot you can do from the Bridge of Sighs,” said Professor Grimes.",
  "“Dreams, images, that sort of thing.",
  "I like to think I got pretty good at haunting.",
  "Tell me, did you ever dream of Ramanujan’s Summation? Of journeys into the cold, dark earth? That was me.",
  "But it takes initiative, to your credit.",
  "You put the pieces together.”",
  "",
  "“But how—”",
  "",
  "“I knew you’d come.",
  "You’ve too much on the line.",
  "You’ve always been so dogged about your degree.",
  "I never doubted once.”",
  "",
  "Alice could not make sense of this.",
  "“But then—why didn’t you just wait for us?”",
  "",
  "“Why would I do that?”",
  "",
  "“But you could have just stayed in the fields.",
  "We would have rescued you in minutes—”",
  "",
  "“Oh, Alice.”",
  "He shook his head.",
  "“You’re always in such a rush, that’s your problem.",
  "We have talked about this.",
  "You always want to be finished, you just want the end result—results, paper, fellowship, job.",
  "Stop barreling toward the end point, start lingering in the process.",
  "There’s so much that will reveal itself to you if you just pause and have a look around.",
  "Smell the roses!”",
  "",
  "“But we’ve got to get back up—”",
  "",
  "“No, we don’t,” said Professor Grimes.",
  "",
  "“But what do you mean?” Alice felt so stupid then.",
  "She always felt so stupid in their advisee meetings, when her mind couldn’t keep up with his racing thoughts.",
  "Always she needed clarification; always she lagged three steps behind.",
  "He had all these visions that her mind was too dull to see; she had to beg him to show her.",
  "“I mean—where else would we go?”",
  "",
  "“Wrong question, Law.",
  "The better question is this: what are that limits of that little tree? Oh, it’ll be difficult here in Hell—there’s precious little chalk, and dwindling materials to write on.",
  "But we’ll make do.",
  "We’ll memorize as much as we can.",
  "It’s a perfect research environment—no distractions, no bodily needs—”",
  "",
  "“You have no bodily needs,” said Alice.",
  "“I will starve to death in short order.”",
  "",
  "“Then starve to death and beg for your life back later,” Professor Grimes said impatiently.",
  "“We have the Dialetheia, Alice, we can do anything.”",
  "",
  "“But—that’s insane.”",
  "She blinked dully at him.",
  "Oh, why was this so difficult—why could she never keep up?",
  "“Why would we stay?”",
  "",
  "“The scholar does not fear death.",
  "Have you learned nothing from Socrates?” Professor Grimes laughed.",
  "“The life of a scholar is mere training for dying, don’t you see? I never understood how right Socrates was until the moment of my death, when my soul was ripped free from my body, and I was cast violently from that mortal world of base appetites.",
  "The body is the enemy, is a hindrance in the soul’s quest for the truth.",
  "It is as the Zhuangzi claims: life is a swelling tumor, and death the bursting of a boil.",
  "We are slaves to the body! All it provides is distractions—fantasies, desires, illnesses, fears.",
  "We are bounded, and death is the ultimate freedom.",
  "I never saw it until now.” Professor Grimes’s hands grasped her face, and though she felt nothing solid, the chill took her breath away.",
  "“Come on, Law.",
  "This isn’t hard.”",
  "",
  "Alice had been here before.",
  "",
  "The Lethe had not washed this memory clean.",
  "Nothing could ever wash this memory clean.",
  "It was engraved in her skull, it constituted her very being, and she was doomed to repeat it, over and over; no matter where she ran, everything brought her right back to this moment.",
  "Details of that night rose to her mind’s eye, all superimposed over King Yama’s throne.",
  "They stood in the same positions—he too close, hands on her cheeks; her frozen in position, head tilted up, eyes wide.",
  "Now, this was a proper seduction, whispered that evil contrarian that lived always in Alice’s skull.",
  "This was how that moment in the office should have gone.",
  "Instead of offering up his body, that stinking solid thing, he should have offered to her the key to the hidden world, and an eternity to play around within it.",
  "",
  "He seemed to recognize the resemblance, for his smile stretched, and he drew even closer.",
  "He knew what that night meant to her; he’d only ever been pretending it didn’t matter.",
  "Let us play it back, let us do this properly.",
  "Here is the world, Alice Law.",
  "Here is a chance to be like me, to be me.",
  "You and I, spirits soaring, and rising close to meet the gods.",
  "Alice tried, but could not shake off the double vision.",
  "Suddenly she couldn’t be sure where she was.",
  "If she let her concentration slip for one second then she found herself back in his office, like no time had passed, like everything that had transpired in Hell had been a dream.",
  "She was a second-year at Cambridge, her future in the balance, and all she needed to do this time was give in.",
  "",
  "“Join me,” said Professor Grimes.",
  "His cloak enveloped them both.",
  "Made them the unit Alice had always longed for; he their champion, she his shadow.",
  "“Join me in the realm of the gods, and we will dance through the hidden world.",
  "We will live and die and live again, until these concepts hold no meaning for us.",
  "We will go where no one has ever gone.",
  "We will return, and speak to dazzled crowds of all the wonderful things we saw.”",
  "",
  "Alice could not speak so much as move her mouth into shapes and hope her breath gave them sound.",
  "“But I don’t want to die.”",
  "",
  "“What do you want, then?”",
  "",
  "“I just want to go home.”",
  "",

  "Yang biasa tidak bisa dibandingkan.",
  "Sekarang, di akhirat, dia melihatnya lebih jelas dari sebelumnya; sebagian karena dia tidak lagi begitu takut melihat, dan sebagian karena dia hanya melihat apa yang dia pilih untuk ditunjukkan.",

  "Mantra Erichtho adalah salah satu karya terbaik yang pernah dilakukannya.",
  "Membuka portal ke Neraka, mengungkap jejak Erichtho, memahami arsip-arsip busuk, semuanya.",
  "Sungguh ini adalah karya ilmiah tingkat atas.",
  "Ketika Alice benar-benar memikirkannya, inilah hal terburuk yang pernah dilakukan Profesor Grimes padanya—membuatnya ragu bahwa dia adalah seorang cendekiawan yang baik.",
  "Beliau telah menghancurkan keyakinannya pada kemampuannya sendiri untuk berpikir, dan menilai hasil pemikirannya, alih-alih berpaling padanya di setiap langkah untuk konfirmasi.",

  "Para penyihir punya teori tentang itu.",
  "Kapur terbaik untuk mantra adalah kapur yang digunakan pencetusnya.",

  "Betapa jauh lebih sulit meraih ingatan yang dia tidak yakin ada di sana.",
  "Kabur sekarang adalah garis antara ingatan dan imajinasi.",
  "Dia tidak bisa memercayai pikirannya untuk tidak menciptakan apa yang dia harapkan dia lihat.",
